This means that you are now transcending the three gunas of diverse worldly attributes and proceeding towards the knowledge of Unity. The thumb represents Brahman. Now, slowly pass each bead with the tip of the thumb towards you. When the bead passes over, the mergence with Brahman is emphasized with every bead, every breath while the tongue too repeats a mantra or name of the Lord. The Japamala is very useful for the beginners in Sadhana, but as you progress, Japa must become the very breath of your life and the Japamala should become superfluous. The safety float has to be discarded when you have learnt to swim, the crutches when you are able to walk. Always, at all times, in all places, the Lord has to be meditated upon.',
