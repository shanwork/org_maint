                        SOOO... This is THAT YEAR, <strong>TWENTY TWENTY The year of COVID 19</strong>, that stupid 'pandemic' which is keeping us home, working remotely where (especially) time blurs and one needs to, 
                        more often, consult the calendar to find out the DATE. Other Crap happening - directly or indirectly - suicides, murders, brutality giving the media enough fodder for 7 
                        generations, spikes in social media posts which in all likelihood has FB and others scurrying to make sure their software is scaleable or / and get more hardware....

                        It has been a very interesting journey for us all so far; started off in holiday mood, now <strong>SIMPLY GOTOGETOUTOFHERE AND CANTSTANDMYSOsSNORING!!</strong><br/>
                        The term 'open prison' comes to mind where you have to force yourself to tone down, calm and restrain yourself. Hygiene is now thrust down one's throat, meal times deviate from 
                        the '12 - 1:00 PM (or similar)' like a yo-yo on steroids.. Thinking of eating out is like enlisting in the Army and wondering if you would get in the line of fire<br/> (Night clubs and discos? FORGET IT!!!)</strong>

                        We could go completely fazed out and become similar to the Human race running and hiding from Terminators and Skynet's and Legion's

                        It's time to re-invent. It's time to work around. It's time to find alternatives.. 
        
                    </p>
                    <p>The resourceful and the imaginative are finding ways to keep themselves busy and out of 'mechanical stagnation'. Many share their ideas and others take these up following them 100% or
                        adaptive and further innovating. <br/>
                        I started taking singing lessons, and some friends and I started a Whatsapp group and would do a Zoom meeting to present some of our extra curricular skills 
                    </p>
                    <p id="reintro"> I reconnected with an old friend, a hobby neglected and cast away, mothballed for so many years that I dont even want to remember when I last indulged (in it).. <br>
                      <strong>Drawing, plain monochrome drawing</strong>. I used to draw a lot of trains and planes when a kid. Scribble and doodle in notebooks using pens and pencils. So here I picked it up. Taking baby steps
                    using a mechanical pencil, 0.7 mm 2b lead, eraser and A4 print paper, I have been drawing left right and center as opportunity permits. <br/>
