         <h3>Shree Mayureswhar of Moregaon</h3>
        <p>&nbsp;"MOR" in Marathi means peacock. The village had a lot of peacocks and the village boundary resembled that of a peacock, and hence the village was named as Moregaon. It is situated on the banks of river Karha. This is 64 Kms. from Pune and state transport bus service is available to reach the place.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The present temple structure was built during the Mughal period, though the idol is very ancient. It is facing north. There is a Nandi (the bull of Lord Siva) facing Lord Ganesha. The Nandi is not fully carved.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The legend says that while this Nandi was being taken for installation in a Siva temple, the cart carrying it broke down in front of the Ganesha temple. Inspite of all efforts, the big Nandi could not be lifted back on to the cart. it was therefore, installed there itself.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The idol of Lord Ganesha is in the sitting posture, with the trunk on left side. There are diamonds on eyes, and due to frequent application of vermilion (sindur) over the idol the original carved shape is lost. However after around 100-125 years the thick coating of vermilion comes off and at that time the original idol is visible. The sindur last fell off in the years 1788 and 1882.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The story about this place goes as under: (Ganesh Purana)<br />Once upon a time there was a city called Gandaki. The king of this place was Chakrapani. He had no children. Following the advice of a sage, he worshipped the Sun deity, and was blessed with immortality by the deity. He conquered all the kings on the earth as well as Indra and Lord Vishnu and then proceeded to Kailash, the abode of Lord Siva. All gods were very unhappy and they prayed to Lord Ganesha. Pleased by their worship, Lord Ganesha incarnated as son of Parvati and fought with Sindhu. In the great battle that took place, Sindhu (Kamalasur) was killed by cutting his body into three pieces. The head of Sindhu fell near Morgaon, and the villagers constructed a temple for Lord Ganesha there. Lord Ganesha fought this battle by riding a peacock, and He was known as Mayureshwar.</p>
