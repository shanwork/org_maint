    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The temple has a hall of 54 X 51 feet carved into the mountain. It is interestingto note that such a big hall exists without any supporting pillar within it.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The idol of Lord Ganesha does not have a proper carving of its shape and it is told that Lord Ganesha is sitting with his back towards the entrance of the temple, facing the other side of the mountain. Efforts to dig from other side to see the face of the Lord could not succeed so far. There are other idols on the sides, which are being worshipped, but these have been added in the recent past. There are 17 or 18 caves in the mountain, but they are all in total darkness and no one dares to get into them.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The legend connected with the temple runs thus: (Ganesh Purana)<br/>
    Goddess Parvati (also know as Girija) desired to have Vinayaka as her son. So she did Tapas for 12 years at this place. Vinayaka was pleased and agreed to be her son. Soon he incarnated as Girija's son. It is said that Lord Ganesha spent about 15 years in these caves during childhood with Girija. There was a deep forest in this area, and the Asuras used to disturb the yagnas of Rishis. Ganesha destroyed them and rendered te place trouble free. Atmaj means son, and since Lord Ganesha was born to Girija, he came to be known as Girijatmaj.</p>
