    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The story about this place goes as under: (Ganesh Purana)<br />
In Vidharbha, there was a king named Bhim who was very brave. He had no children for a long time. With the blessings of Lord Vinayaka. He got a son, equally brave and handsome and also a devotee of Lord Ganesha. He was named Rukmangad. Once he went for hunting and was overcome by thirst. He went to the nearby Ashram of Vachakni Rishi. The wife of the Rishi, Mukunda, saw this handsome king and was infatuated by him. The request to fulfill her desire was turned down by the king. Mukunda cursed the king and he became a leper. He then performed Tapas for long years. Narad Muni happened to pass that way. He saw the king and told him to go to Kadamb lake and take a dip. The king did so and he was releived of the leprosy. Lord Indra who came to know about Mukunda's desire, disguised himself as Rukmangad, and procreated a son in her, named Grudsamad. The boy grew up to be a very learned, brave and noble person. He was, however, belittled by some rishis on the grounds of his birth. Grudsamad was upset by this and he retired to the forests and performed severe tapas for years on end, standing on one toe and eating only dry leaves. Finally Lord Vinayaka was pleased by his tapas and gave him a boon(Var) due to which he became so reknowned a Rishi, that his name came to be chanted at the start of Ganesg Mantra. Since Lord Vinayaka had given boon(Var) at this place, He was known as Varad Vinayaka, the Lord who bestows boons.</p>
