    <h3>Shree Ballaleshwar of Pali</h3>
    <p>Pali is 110 Kms. from Pune and 30 Kms. from Karjat. Buses from Pune are Karjat are available to reach Pali.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The temple is situated at one end of the village and is facing east. The idol is about 3 feet high. The special attraction here is a big bell in the temple which is made of "Panchadhatu" (alloy of five metals). This big bell was manufactured in Europe and was brought to India and installed in the church of Vasai-Sasti in Konkan.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;One Chimajee Appa of the Peshva regime defeated the Portugese and brought the bell from the church and fixed it up in the temple.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a small temple of Dhundi Vinayaka claimed to be "Swayambhu" behind Balleleshwar temple. This Vinayaka is offered the first worship every day, before worship is done in the Ballaleshwar temple.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The story about this place goes as under: (Ganesh Purana)<br/>Once upon a time there lived a grocer named Kalyan with his wife. They had a son named Ballal. He was very fond of worship of Lord Vinayaka. His sincerity was so transparent that even his friends started following him. This worried the villagers, because they thought that their children would become lazy and not do any useful work for their families. They complained to the grocer. He got wild with anger and went into the forest in search of Ballal to teach him a lesson. Ballal was in deep meditation when his father came. His friends deserted him and ran away. His father, Kalvan broke the idol of Ganesha in front of the meditating Ballal, beat him mercilessly, tied him to a tree and went home. Lord Ganesha took the form of a Brahmin and freed Ballal and heeled all the wounds sustained at the hands of his father. Ballal intuitively recognised the true form of the Brahmin and prostrated to him. Pleased by the devotion, the Lord asked as to what boon he wanted. Ballal requested the Lord to stay there permanently in the forest. The Brahmin thereupon disappeared and there stood in his place a big black rock with the form of Ganesha carved on it.<br/><br/>This idol came to be known after the devotee, as Sri Ballaleshwar Vinayaka.</p>
