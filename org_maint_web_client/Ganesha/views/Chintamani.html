    <h3>Shree Chintamani of Theur</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one of the most famous Ashtavinayaka temples. It is situated on the banks of River Mula-Mutha which flows through the city of Pune. Theur is only 22 Kms. from Pune and even city buses go to this place.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The temple's main gate is facing north but the idol of Ganesha is facing east. This is a big temple, originally built by Gosavi Moraya and then renovated during the period of Madhavrao Peshva. Madhavrao was a great devotee of Ganesha and he used to worship at this temple before proceeding for any battle and also after returning from his battles.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Chimajee Appa, another warrior and brother of Bajirao Peshva had brought a few church bells from Vasai after defeating the Portugese and one of the bells was installed here. On the Ghats of the river near the temple, Ramabai the queen of Madhavrao Reshva had committed 'SATI' on the funeral pyre of her husband when the latter died. As such, this temple is of historic importance also. All secret meetings of the Maratha rulers used to take place here during the Peshva period.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two or three legends about this temple and the name Chintamani given to Lord Ganesha. One of them goes as under.<br/>
        Prince Gana, the son of king Abhijeet, was a brave warrior but was very short tempered. Once he went to Kapil Rishi where he saw a diamond named Chintamani. It was a magic diamond and the power to bring forth anything that the possessor wanted. Gana wanted this diamond; and when the rishi refused it, he snatched it from him. Kapil Rishi worshipped Vinayaka who was pleased with him and promised to get back the diamond from Gana. Vinayaka destroyed Gana and got back the diamond. By that time Kapil had lost all desire for the diamond. It was not taken by kapil Rishi, but instead he wanted Ganeshji to stay there. Ganeshji took up the name of this diamond and remained there under a Kadamb tree and came to be known as Chintamani Vinayaka. The village was known as Kadamb</p>
