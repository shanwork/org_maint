    <h3>Siddhivinayak Mahaganapati Temple of Titwala</h3>
    <p>The Siddhivinayaka Mahaganapati Temple is a Hindu temple located in Titwala (Marathi: सिद्धिविनायक महागणपती मंदिर, टिटवाळा) – a small town in the Kalyan taluka of Thane district – near Mumbai, Maharashtra, India. The temple is dedicated to the Hindu, elephant-headed god of wisdom Ganesha. Titwala is believed to be the putative site of the hermitage of sage Kanva, foster parent of Shakuntala who was born here. The place is steeped in ancient legend and the temple is frequented by a very large number of devotees on account of the belief that separated married couples could be united and marriages of desired people could be fixed easily if the Ganesha image installed in the temple is worshipped with devotion.</p>
