    A collection of sayings collected by our modern day Hemadpant related to spiritiual freedom. Jayasimha Prasad started Sai Amruta Vani (literal translation 'Words or Voice of Nectar') on August 10 2010. 
    <p>Jayasimha gleans and searches different sources to find prophetic and wise sayings, narrations of stories and other snippets relevant to spirituality and love. He has developed a super knack of posting something which is so relevant at that point of time!!! Appears that he is being guided by a Supreme force... </p>
    <p> This is divided by week and starts with last weeks' sayings. At this point, the list starts with the past week (as mentioned) then extends to a few weeks back (how many is, right now, dynamic!!) <span style="color:black; font-weight:bolder"> *</span>. <p/>Hoping to iteratively add more content with a long term goal to be able to post all past and present sayings</p>
    <p>Hope you enjoy and absorb these pearls and gain from them!! </p>
    <p style="padding-top:100px;">* Sometimes it may not align to a calendar week, or the order may be changed, to preserve continuity of a series of postings</p>   ** This will take you to the weekwise page - you can navigate to all weeks from there
