He was born to a pious Brahmin couple Sivaguru and Aryaamba in a village named Kaladi in Kerala. He wanted to become a Sanyaasi (a celibate and renunciate) at a young age and his mother did not accept his proposal. One day, when Sankara was taking a bath in a nearby river, a crocodile caught his feet. He started crying, “Mother! Mother! This crocodile is pulling me into the water. It is not going to leave me until you permit me to become a Sanyaasi.” His mother, at last, gave him permission and Sankara was released by the crocodile'
                            + '<br/><u>Deeper meaning:</u>The inner meaning of the episode is that the river is comparable to Samsaara (worldly life) and the crocodile is vishaya (sensual pleasures). Man is dragged into the river of worldly life by the crocodile of sensual pleasures. Release is possible only by renunciation or detachment.'
                            + '<br/><u>His message:</u>Truth (Reality) can never change with time. Since the world changes with time, it is not real. Brahman (God) alone is real, this world is unreal; the Jeeva (individual Self) is none other than Brahman. (Brahma Satya Jagat Mithya Jeevo Brahmaiva Na Aparah). Adi Sankara wrote commentaries on Bhagavad Gita, Brahma Sutras and the Upanishads'
                            + '<br/><u>Note:</u>Adi Shankaracharya, also known as Sankara Bhagavatpadacharya, is the greatest Hindu saint and Indian philosopher who consolidated the doctrine of Advaita Vedanta. Adi Shankara’s teachings were mainly based on Advaita (Non-dualism) – or the unity of Brahman and the soul. Adi Sankaracharya is also regarded as an incarnation of Lord Shiva, who took the avatar to teach and guide the Hindu religion.</p>'
                            + '<p><u>Life: Sri Ramanujacharya</u>(1027-1147A.D) was a proponent of Vishistadvaita Philosophy (qualified Non-dualism) was born in Sri Perambudur, a village near Chennai. Ramanuja was very liberal in his outlook. He admitted even lower caste people (Harijans) to enter the temple of Tiru Narayana at Melkote in Karnataka state. He hugged even the downtrodden to his bosom. He wrote a commentary on Brahma Sutras and three books on Vedanta- Essence of Vedanta, A Resume of Vedanta and Light of Vedanta.'
                            + '<br/><u>His message:</u>According to Vishistadvaita, God has attributes, which are real and permanent, but subject to His control. Jeevas (individual souls) always remain distinct from Him both in bondage and in liberation. In bondage, Jeeva is one with the matter; in liberation it is one with God, without its individuality being lost in either of these cases.</p>'

So, she asked Lord Narayana, “Please give me the boon so that you will be born in my womb”. Lord Narayana granted her boon saying that in her next birth He will be born to her. She thought that she could love the Lord even more because as a baby, she could nurse Him, fondle Him with love, feed Him, bathe Him, clothe Him and play with Him.'

The tape recorder can also repeat the Name of the Lord. So, we should not chant the Name of the Lord mechanically. We should do it with full awareness. Everything should come out of the heart, not merely out of the lips. We should imprint the divine feelings in the heart and chant the Name of the Lord',

Dharma is depicted as a four legged animal (like a cow for example). It rests all its four legs on the earth when there is only pure Dharma. When the Dharma declines slightly, it lifts one leg and three legs are on the earth. This is Threta Yuga because of three legs are on the earth. When Dharma declines further, two legs are up and only two legs are on the earth. This is Dwapara Yuga. In Kali Yuga (the present Yuga), only one leg is down and three are up and Dharama is in its last (lost!) legs',

+ '<li>Rama is the Indweller in every Body. He is the Atma-Rama, the Rama (Source of Bliss) in every individual. His blessings surging up from that inner Spring can confer Peace and Bliss.<br/> The Ramayana, the Rama story, teaches two lessons: the value of detachment, and the need to become aware of the Divine in every being.<br/> Faith in God and detachment from objective pursuits are the keys for human liberation. Give up sense-objects; you gain Rama.<br/> Sita gave up the luxuries of Ayodhya and so, she could be with Rama, in the period of \'exile\'. When she cast longing eyes on the golden deer and craved for it, she lost the presence of Rama.<br/> Renunciation leads to joy; attachment brings about grief. Be in the world, but, not of it.<br/> The brothers, comrades, companions and collaborators of Rama are each of them examples of persons saturated with Dharma.'
+ '<li> Dasaratha is the representative of the merely physical, with the ten senses.'
+ '<li> The three Gunas - Sathwa, Rajas and Thamas - are the three Queens.'
+ '<li> The Four Goals of Life (Dharma, Artha, Kama, Moksha) - the Purusharthas - are the four Sons. Lakshmana is the Intellect; Sugriva is Viveka or Discrimination. Vali is Despair. Hanuman is the embodiment of Courage.'
+ '<li> The Bridge is built over the Ocean of Delusion. The three Rakshasa chiefs are personifications of the Rajasic (Ravana), Thamasic (Kumbhakarna) and the Sathwic qualities (Vibhishana). '
+ '<li>Sita is Brahma jnana or the Awareness of the Universal Absolute, which the Individual must acquire and regain undergoing travails in the crucible of Life.'
+ '<li> Make your heart pure and strong, contemplating the grandeur of the Ramayana. Be established in the faith that Rama is the Reality of your existence.',

Go and say ‘Rama’ to the calf and tell me what happens.” Narada rushed to the village with enthusiasm. There, a poor brahmin owned this cow and was selling the milk to make a living.

With hesitation, he approached the king and the king was extremely happy to see sage Narada visit his palace. The king gave a grand welcome to Narada and took him to his chambers to show the new born baby. Narada looked at the baby boy.  He was very beautiful and chubby. Narada touched the baby boy and blessed him. Then he said, “Rama!” and closed his eyes being afraid of the outcome. He heard the voice, “O revered sage Narada! How blessed I am! You have taken me through three births by simply chanting name ‘Rama’ in my ears. Now that same mantra has given me the power to speak. I am forever grateful to you for liberating me!” Narada opened his eyes and found that the baby was actually saying all these words with a smile on its face.'

Why did you kill the calf and created a problem for the Brahmin family who was dependent on the cow for his livelihood?” Lord Narayana smilingly said, “He was all the time thinking of his cow and its milk for his livelihood. He never thought of Me! So, I have to take it away from him so that he will turn his attention to Me!” – Story as narrated by Sri Sathya Sai Baba',

Precisely at that moment devotees started chanting \'Arunachala Siva, Arunachala Siva\'. When Ramana heard this, his face lit up with radiant joy. Tears began to flow from his eyes and continued to flow for a long time. I was wiping them from time to time. I was also giving him spoonful of water boiled with ginger. Ramana’s breathing became gradually slower and slower and at 8:47 p.m. it subsided quietly.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; –Swami Satyananda'

I was in the open space in front of my house, when my friends drew my attention to the sky, where I saw a vividly-luminous shooting star with a luminous tail, unlike any shooting star I had before seen, coming from the South, moving slowly across the sky and, reaching the top of Arunachala, disappeared behind it. Because of its singularity we all guessed its import and immediately looked at our watches – it was 8:47 – and then raced to the Ashram only to find that our premonition had been only too sadly true: the Master had passed into Nirvana at that very minute.</i></p>',

+ 'Hanuman was watching their movements, listening to their confabulations, and laughing within himself all the while. When they had finished, he burst into a thunderbolt of laughter! The Rakshasas were enraged at this display of insulting behavior. They procured cloth and oil and started the process of winding and soaking. But the more they wound and soaked, the longer grew the tail! Miles of cloth and tanks of oil had to be ordered. News of the wonder spread all over the City and crowds of men, women and children ran towards the Hall to witness the miracle. Meanwhile, bands of musicians led the procession. Crowds began clapping hands. Hanuman was led along the streets with oil soaked cloth wound along the whole length of his tail. At last, the Central Square of the City of Lanka was reached. There, before a huge crowd of eager citizens, a burning flame was applied to the tip of Hanuman’s tail. Suddenly, Hanuman assumed his subtle form, and so the ropes that had bound him became too loose and fell off. He could now assume his natural size and jump about. He rose in one jump on to the top of a golden mansion. He shouted Rama, Rama, and made the Rakshasas shudder in fear, for, a strong wind rose from nowhere and blew with great speed. Hanuman somersaulted in the air and was beside himself with joy. He jumped from one mansion to another, with the burning tail trailing behind him. The tail grew longer and longer. The conflagration swelled in size as he moved from street to street. The mansions all over the City of Lanka were caught in the conflagration and changed into heaps of ashes. The Rakshasas fled desperately with their wives and children, forsaking their burning homes, eager to save their lives. To add to the confusion, cattle, horses, mules and elephants broke away from their sheds and ran helter-skelter in panic and pain. The entire City was enveloped in a shroud of wails, cries, roars and trumpeting. “Oh! Save us.” “Oh! Take us to a safe place”… agonising appeals like these rose from the throats of women and children and echoed from the sky.'
+ '<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sita heard the news. She raised her head and had one long look at the smoke and sparkle surrounding the garden. The sky was darkened by smoke! The garden too had become uncomfortably hot. Sita called upon the God of Fire without delay and prayed that He should save Hanuman, the genuine Bhaktha of Rama. Since she prayed out of a compassionate heart, it became suddenly cool and comfortable for Hanuman. Ravana suffered loss and dishonor for discarding the advice given by elders and for indulging in vulgar talk, when he was shown the proper road. In just under a wink, the capital city of his empire was wiped out by fire. The house where Kumbhakarna was asleep, and the house of that super most among devotees, Vibhishana were the only two that were not erased by the fire. Hanuman leaped into the sea and dipped his tail in the waters to put out the flame. Then he assumed the form of a miniature monkey and reached the place where Sita was. He prostrated before her and said, “Mother! I shall relate to Rama all that you have asked me to. Give me something so that I could prove that I have met you.”'
+ '<h4>Last meeting with Sita</h4>'
+ 'Sita thought for a while, and taking from her head a gemset jewel, she placed it in Hanuman’s hand. Hanuman pressed it over his eye reverently and fell at Sita’s feet again, overcome with joy. Sita blessed him, and said, “Hanuman!You saw with your own eyes the torture Ravana is inflicting on me, and therefore there is no need for me to dilate on that. Tell the Lord that he must grant me the fortune of his darsan. Tell him that I prayed for it again and again. Tell him that, with Lakshmana, he must lay siege to Lanka, within a month. Hanuman! These three days I spent happily, speaking to you of Rama. My heart has become calm and cool. I cannot imagine how I will spend both night and day, hereafter, when you are gone. I shall be a fish in a dry pond. Of course, the omniscient Lord is ever watching over me; but when, oh when shall I feast my eyes on those lotus eyes of His?” Hanuman tried to infuse faith and courage in her mind by his assurances and assertions. He prayed, pleaded and prostrated again and again. At last he turned toward his path.'
+ '<h4>Hanuman is back</h4>'
+ 'Without any more delay Hanuman reached the shore of the sea. He filled his mind with the thought of Rama and his eyes with His charm; and even while meditating on that Name and Form, he leaped over the sea and reached the other shore in a trice. That day was the Full Moon of the month Karthik. The cool moonlight was as balm to the heart. The name of Rama implanted strength and joy. Hanuman had won. The monkey groups who had espied Hanuman from the distance coming through the horizon were elated beyond words. They were filled with joy. Their faces blossomed. They shone with a new splendor as they saw him come nearer and nearer. They exulted that they had fulfilled the mission on which they were sent by Rama.'
+ '<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as Hanuman touched ground, they asked him about what happened in Lanka, about Sita and her welfare, and circumstances and conditions of Lanka. Hanuman told them all they wanted, with high enthusiasm, and left for where Rama was. Hanuman said, “Oh Lord of my Life. It is impossible to describe. Sita is reduced to bones, for she does not take food nor does she sleep. She is counting every minute praying for your Darshan. She has no other thought than the recitation of your name. She wanted me to inform you of her countless prostrations. She remembered Lakshmana often and shed profuse tears. The sharp verbal dagger thrusts that Ravana administers every morning and evening when he comes to her and speaks to her, I have heard with my own ears. Mother does not listen to his prattle in the least. She is ever melting away in the agony of separation and in thoughts centered on you.” “Save Sita this very moment!” cried Hanuman falling at the feet of Rama.'
+ '<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing these words, Lakshmana rose in vengeful anger and wept at Sita’s condition. The picture of Sita in Lanka burnt his inner being. He said at last, “Brother! Do not delay. Save my sister-in-law!” Rama replied with a smile, “Lakshmana! Do not hurry. Bide your time. There is a time when each step has to be taken. Do not be dejected when grief invades or exult when joy flows in.” Rama consoled him with soft and soothing words.'

Sighting this, a Rakshasa guard wanted to frighten him away but Hanuman gave him a blow which felled him to the ground. He ran to the head of the gang of guards. He fled in terror to his superior in office and he in turn approached his master. Thus, the news of a monkey rioting in the garden reached the Imperial ears of Ravana himself. It struck Ravana as an evil omen. He could not restrain his anger at the mischief and the insult. The flames of his ire rose to the skies. He ordered a few hundred Rakshasas to overwhelm and catch the audacious animal. Since they could not succeed in their mission, he sent a few thousand trained and heavily armed Soldier-Rakshasas into the garden where Hanuman was awaiting their onslaught. Even that formidable force could not harm the monkey or persuade him to move off. Hanuman broke a dry twig from the tree on which he sat and with that tiny weapon which he waved around to the recital of Ram, Ram, he warded off every missile that was directed at him. Seeing this, the Rakshasas wondered who he was. Was he an emissary of the Gods? Or, was he the harbinger of the destruction of Lanka? The defeated heroes returned to camp, burdened with premonitions of disaster. They had no courage left to report their discomfiture to their ruler, Ravana.'
+ '<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;At this, Ravana sent his own dear son, Akshayakumara, at the head of thousands of seasoned Warrior-Rakshasas. But Hanuman slaughtered this host in a trice, and Ravana had to mourn the death of his beloved son. The entire land shivered in fear at the news of the death of the Prince and the decimation of his army. People whispered in fear, that this was no ordinary monkey, that it must be a Divine Phenomenon, and that it was the terrible avenger for the sin of bringing Sita over to Lanka. Many prayed to Sita in their heart of hearts to deliver Lanka from the monkey, for they feared it was her vengeance that had taken shape as that strange beast. Ravana sent word for Meghanada, and commissioned him to destroy this new invader. He placed at his disposal a huge army of several thousands. Meghanada ascended his chariot and led the heroic army in great pomp. As they marched along, earth and sky were astounded at their might and their angry tread. Their war cry rent the heavens. All who witnessed that pageantry and panoply were struck with wonder and admiration. Hanuman watched their march and heard their trumpeting with absolute unconcern.'
+ '<h4>Hanuman captured</h4>'
+ 'He sat unmoved, on a little branch of the spreading tree, and enjoyed the antics of the Rakshasas until they drew near. The soldiers rained arrows on Hanuman from all sides. With one ear-splitting roar, Hanuman jumped down and plucking a giant tree by its roots, he waved it round, beating off the rain of arrows that tried to reach him. The arrows were swept off so fast that when they hit back the Rakshasas who shot them, the impact killed them in such large numbers that very few were left to carry on the fight. Meghanada was felled by a blow. He rolled, spouting blood. So, he resolved to resort to the sacred arrow of Brahma that he had with him. He knew that Brahma, the first of the Trinity, had told Ravana that he would meet his death at the hands of man and monkey. He decided to prevent that calamity. The Brahmaastra was released with appropriate ritual formulae. Hanuman had great reverence for the weapon that is sanctified by such manthras and dedicated to Brahma. So, he did not counteract it. He reverentially prostrated before it. So, it was easy for Meghanada to bind him with the Serpent Rope.'
+ '<h4>Ravana questions Hanuman</h4>'
+ 'The happy news was immediately carried to Ravana by the exultant Rakshasas. Lakhs of eager faces crowded the streets to see the monkey that had been bound. Hanuman was unaffected by fear or anxiety. He remained calm and collected watching the crowds with an amused smile. At last, he reached the Audience Hall of Ravana. The courtiers and ministers assembled there were aghast at the insulting indifference shown by Hanuman to the display of power and luxury that the Hall contained. Ravana laughed aloud at the absurd figure of the monkey; but the next moment, he was overcome by fear of impending death. However, anger was the overriding emotion at that time in him. He asked, “Hey, you monkey! Who are you really? Whose is the might that you have been exhibiting and using? Why did you destroy this orchard and this park? Though bound, you have no sense of shame. You look around with your head high up. Come on, give me the right answers.”'
+ '<h4>Hanuman replies</h4>'
+ 'Hanuman had a hearty laugh at his interrogator. He used for his replies a style of speech and a vocabulary which were beyond the understanding of the people who stood around him. But Ravana, who was an expert in rhetoric and grammar, understood him quite well and the dialogue between them appeared to the listeners like a disputation between two intellectual giants. Ravana demonstrated before Hanuman several magic feats in order to impress him with his invincibility. He manifested many powers and feats. But Hanuman remained unmoved. He said, “Ravana, I know your prowess. I have heard that you fight with a thousand arms. I am aware also of your famous fight with Vali. But what wrong have I done? I was hungry. I plucked a few trees by their roots. It is my nature. I was in my element, my natural habitat, the tree top. Of course, each one has the desire and the determination to safeguard his own life, to protect his own body. Your soldiers are awfully wicked. They hurt me. So, I hurt them, and unable to bear the hurt, they died. I fought with them in order to save myself. The arrow of your son forced me to enter into his bondage. But I am not trying to deceive you in return. My only desire is to carry out the orders of my Master.'
+ '<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen to me carefully. Give up all sense of personal pride and reputation. Reflect on the grandeur of your clan, the family to which you belong. Remember, you are the great-grandson of Brahma. You are the grandson of the great Pulastya. You are the son of Visravas. Give up this delusion of accumulating pomp and power; adore in your heart the Destroyer of Fear from the hearts of those devoted to Him, the Crown Jewel of the Ikshvaku Dynasty, the precious Gem of the Raghu Dynasty, Rama! Surrender to Him, take refuge in Him. Even Time shivers in fear before Him. It is not good for you to harbor enmity towards Him. Listen to me. Place Sita at the Lotus Feet of Rama, and meditate on the Grace that flows from those Feet. Strengthened by that Grace, rule over the state of Lanka for ever and ever. Make the glory of your grandfather, Pulastya, reach the far corners of the world, without blemish, so long as the sun and moon illumine the sky. The fair name of your line should not be tarnished by you in the least. Give up your pride and your delusion.'
+ '<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, Emperor! Rivers taking birth on mountain ranges get flooded in the rainy season and roll furiously along. Within weeks, they run dry with just a trickle of water. Your power and wealth will soon dry up and vanish. Adore Rama as the source of power and wealth. Then, they would never get dry; for He is the inexhaustible spring of peace and prosperity. He is ever full. He won’t lose, but you will benefit from Him. Oh Ravana! I am telling you with nothing held back, with an open mind. No one can rescue the unfortunate person who is blinded by hatred towards Rama. Accept my advice.”'
+ '<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;These words of Hanuman were soft and salutary. They were full of wisdom and morality. But Ravana was not prepared to benefit by the counsel. He said, “Fool! How dare you advise me what to do? Fie on you, fie! Death has drawn near you; or else, you would not have the courage to lecture thus so long in my presence. Enough of your prattling and keep your mouth shut!” Hanuman did not obey. He retorted “Ravana! These words of yours spell your doom. Alas, you have become insane. You will know the truth of my diagnosis as time passes. In a few days you can know to whom Death is drawing near, to you or to me!”'
+ '<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;When Hanuman spoke thus, in utter fearlessness, with no bounds or limits, Ravana was enraged beyond control. He rose, spouting fire and slapping his thighs in challenge he roared an order to his henchmen to kill the impertinent monkey. Everyone rushed to where Hanuman sat, bound in snake ropes. Just at that moment, Vibhishana, Ravana’s brother, entered the Hall, followed by his retinue. He prostrated before his elder brother and said, protestingly, “Master! It is not right to kill an emissary. Rajadharma will not approve the deed. Punish him in any other manner, but do not pronounce the sentence of death.” The ministers of Ravana supported this stand and declared that what he had suggested was the noblest truth. Ravana laughed in scorn at their absurd ideas of right and wrong. Still, he  climbed down and said, “Well, mutilate him and send him off.”'
+ '<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;The ministers gathered in a group to decide on the mutilation. They came to the conclusion that monkeys are proud of their tails and would fain keep them intact long and strong. Someone suggested that the best punishment would be to wind sheets of cloth on the tail, pour oil until it soaks and drips and then set fire to the tail. This plan got unanimous acceptance. They exulted among themselves at the brilliance of the idea. “The tailless monkey will proceed to its master and bring him here for avenging the loss. Then we can witness the manliness of his master and his might.” There was a wave of whispers in the Hall.'

+ 'After some time, Sarama, the wife of Vibhishana and her daughter, Thrijata, came to the tree and fell at the feet of Sita sitting disconsolate there under. They enquired about her health. Since they were partial towards her, Sita spoke to them about how the dream of Thrijata had come true, and how a monkey had actually entered Lanka in accordance with it. Sarama and Thrijata showed extreme enthusiasm and excitement when they heard the account of what had happened. They plied Sita with questions, in their eagerness to know all details. Sita showed them the monkey perched on the branch and the Ring it had brought. They both pressed the ring on their eyes in reverent adoration. Hanuman was watching for an opportunity to see Sita while alone and very soon he got it. Hanuman jumped to the ground and whispered to Sita, “Mother! Do not be anxious and grief-stricken. Sit on my back, and I will transport you in a trice to where Rama and Lakshmana are awaiting news about you.” Hanuman pleaded in many ways for acceptance of this plan. Sita replied, “Hanuman, I am indeed very glad to hear you speak thus. I am sunk and struggling in the sorrow of separation. Your sweet words give me solace like a boat on a stormy sea. But do you not know that I will never contact a person other than my Lord? How then can I sit on your back, consider that.” These words of Sita were a sharp repartee which hit Hanuman in the heart and exposed his pettiness and pride for having suggested a dishonorable step.'
+ '<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;But Hanuman recovered soon and said, “Mother! Am I not your son? What is wrong when the son carries the mother on his back? What evil consequence can follow from that?” He supported his idea with various pleadings and points. In reply, Sita declared, “Hanuman! Of course, for me and for you, the feelings of mother and son are real; but, imagine what the world will think of it. We have to consider that aspect also, haven’t we? We must so live that we are ideals for the lives of others. We should not draw upon ourselves by our acts the ridicule, contempt or condemnation of others. No one should point the finger of scorn at us. Above all, we must derive self-satisfaction, as a result of our acts. When I know I cannot derive that satisfaction, I will never attempt such acts. Even if my life departs, I don’t need or crave for another’s assistance.” “Moreover, my Rama has to destroy this vile demon who tortures me. He is the person who has to discharge the responsibility, no one else can. He must come himself into this Lanka, kill this Ravana, and lead this Sita back holding her in His hand—that is the sign of the true hero that He is. That is the sign of genuine valor. Look at this Ravana. He came like a thief in a false form and stole me from my Lord. But Rama is the embodiment  of  righteousness. He observes the norms of right behavior. He honors the spoken word.'
+ '<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;When news spreads that Rama sent a monkey and brought away Sita without the knowledge of Ravana, it would be dishonoring him. Getting out of here in the way you suggest will surely be treason. We should not resort to mean stratagems. We should guard the fair name of Rama as our very breath. His fame is the deity we adore in our hearts. We have to preserve it unimpaired by thought, word and deed. Your proposal has not given me satisfaction for this reason.” Hanuman admired her untarnishable virtue and her steadfast adoration of her Lord, and the loftiness of the ideals she maintained. He extolled her in his mind and recollected her words, in order to draw inspiration therefrom. He said, “Mother, pardon me. Since I saw with my own eyes the tortures you are undergoing and the pangs of separation which Rama is suffering, I entertained this idea to take you as quickly as possible to the Lotus Feet of the Lord. Pardon me if it was wrong,” and fell at her feet, again and again, in great remorse.'
+ '<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;When Hanuman was describing the pathetic condition of the brothers, Sita acted as if she was amazed at the love and affection that Rama had towards her. Again and again, she said, “Yes, you too describe only the misery of the men. What do you know, how can you gauge the sorrows of women?” She pretended not to believe all that Hanuman related to her. She watched Hanuman and appreciated his wisdom and powers. She recalled the story of how Rama and Hanuman had met and came to be bound in love and loyalty, and derived great joy and content therefrom. At last, she got firm faith in Hanuman and his mission.'
+ '<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hanuman knew that it was wrong to spend any more time in Lanka. He felt that the sooner he communicated to Rama the welcome news about Sita the better for all concerned. He prayed for permission to leave. She said, “Go, go safe and soon. Tell Rama to come soon and take me with Him.” She shed tears of hope and sorrow. Hanuman was moved by the pathos of the scene. Sadness  overwhelmed his brave heart. He consoled her and said, “Very soon, Mother, Rama will lay siege to this Lanka, with His Vanara hordes, He will destroy these Rakshasa forces, rescue you and restore you to Ayodhya.”'
+ '<h4>Hanuman takes leave of Sita</h4>'
+ 'But Sita was inconsolable. She had her doubts. “Hanuman, what is it that you say! Can monkey hordes fight against and destroy these Rakshasas who have mastered many a mysterious stratagem and subterfuge, and who are themselves much stronger? How can the two brothers, Rama and Lakshmana, stand up against these demons and win? Victory over the demons is an impossible dream. This can end only in my death. Rather than causing the death of so many of you on the battlefield, I would fain breathe my last and save all your lives.” Sita was lamenting thus, while Hanuman interrupted her and said, “Mother! Do not weep. We of the monkey hordes are the bond slaves of Rama. All of us believe that Rama is our strength and our courage. We take in as our very breath the name, Rama. We have no other source of life. Therefore, even if each of these Rakshasas increases a thousand fold in deviltry, we monkeys can easily destroy them. We can win victory over them in spite of their wiles and wickedness. You are doubting the extent of our strength and skills, since we appear in our habitual forms. Let me show the Form I can assume in battle.” Hanuman rose sky-high, and stood before Sita—a mountain-peak of shining Gold. Sita was astonished at this. She said, “Hanuman! Stop. Stop. Enough! Limit yourself. If the eyes of the Rakshasas fall on you, you may not be able to return soon to Rama.” Sita protested and pleaded with him to assume his old form. Hanuman gave up the terrible form he had converted himself into, and became a quiet little monkey in no time. Hanuman fell at the feet of Sita and turned his steps away. But the plight of Sita and her anguished face were so deeply imprinted on his heart that his feet would not move away.<h5>  to be continued ...</h5>'

And he kept on repeating “Rama! Rama” in ecstatic bliss. When her eyes fell upon the ring, Sita was astonished at what she saw. “Is this true, or am I dreaming? Can it be true? How can this golden ring worn on the tender finger of my Lord be found in Lanka? Is this Rakshasa magic or mere hallucination? No, I should not hesitate any longer, after recognizing it as my Lord’s, to take it in my hand. It will be a sin if I refrain from handling it.” So saying, she took it and placed it on her eyes in reverence. Tears of gratitude flowed from her eyes. “Rama! Are you granting me your Darshan, the joy of your presence through this ring?” she said and raised her head.'
+ '<h4>Sita in jubilant mood</h4>'
+ 'There she saw a small monkey sitting on a branch of the tree and reciting in deep devotion, “Rama, Rama,” continuously. In a flash, she remembered the incidents in Thrijata’s (a rakshasi) dream as related by her. “Ah! Good days seem to be fast approaching. For ten long months, I have not heard the name of Rama pronounced in this Lanka. This day, I am able to see a living being reciting the holy name. I also received the dearly loved ring of my Lord,” she exulted. She could not keep her joyful excitement down. Sita, who had not talked to any stranger for long, looked at the monkey-form and addressed it thus: “Oh monkey! Who are you? Wherefrom is this ring?” She could not put full trust in the monkey, for, she had been deceived for months by tricks of impersonation. She interrogated the monkey in various ways in order to verify his credentials. Off and on, she would ask the monkey about the welfare of Rama and at the very thought of His being alone, in the forest, tears would flow profusely from her eyes. Sita swung alternately between joy and grief. Hanuman watched her plight. He could not keep away from her the bond of love and loyalty that was holding him onto Rama.'
+ '<h4>Hanuman speaks</h4>'
+ 'He related the dynastic story of Rama and His exploits, as well as his own story until he met Rama. When she listened to that story, she felt as happy as when Rama stood before her. She could picture Rama standing beside her at Ayodhya and in the forest retreats. She felt so thrilled that she forgot herself and her condition. Soon, she recovered consciousness and knew where she was. She said, “Oh Monkey! I am glad you told me all this, but let me ask one question: “How were you able to enter this heavily guarded city, in spite of your being only a weak little monkey? How could you escape being caught by these Rakshasas and succeed in spotting out this place and coming to me?” Hanuman replied, “Mother! What skill and strength have I? I am the servant of Rama, His slave. He makes me do everything He wants or likes. Without Him, I cannot survive even a moment. I am a doll in His hands. I play as He pulls the strings. I have no will of my own.” Then, Hanuman elaborated on the glory of Rama and manifested his devotion and dedication in the most impressive manner. It was most thrilling to hear those words of his.'
+ '<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Rama had told Hanuman, for communication to Sita, some incidents which no one else knew. He had said, “It may so happen that Sita may not believe your words. She may doubt your genuineness. Then, you can remind her of these events, which are known only to her and me.” So, Hanuman began relating those special incidents. “Mother Sita, He has asked me to tell you of the attempts made by the wicked Crow to cause injury to you and of His attempt to save you and to kill that demon.” At this, Sita wept aloud, saying, “Hanuman! Why is Rama who was so kind to me then delaying to release me from this torture? Rama is the ocean of mercy. Yes, but why has He become so hardhearted at my fate? No! No! I am wrong. Rama is the embodiment of compassion. He has to play a role that involves all this apparent hard- heartedness, that is all. Hanuman! You are no ordinary individual. For, Rama will not associate Himself so closely with ordinary individuals. Nor will He send His ring with inferior persons. How fortunate you are to be His messenger! Show me once your full stature and form.”'
+ '<h4>Hanuman bows before Sita</h4>'
+ 'Then, Hanuman landed on the ground and stood before Sita with palms folded in adoration. When Sita saw him growing into a huge and terror-inducing size, she half suspected it to be some demonic trick. She closed her eyes and turned aside! Realizing her fear and the suspicion that was at the basis of that fear, Hanuman said, “Mother! I am neither Ravana nor any one of his devilish Rakshasas. I am the faithful servant of Rama with the pure sacred body of unequalled splendor. He is the very breath of my existence, believe me. I am speaking the Truth. Guessing that you may not have faith in my being His authentic messenger, He took off His finger this golden ring and placed it in my hands to be given to you. With me, there came Jambavan, Nila, Angada and thousands of others of extraordinary heroism. But I alone was able to cross the ocean through the Grace of Rama. The others are all on the other shore. We were able to hear from Jatayu and Sabari the story of your having been brought here by this villainous Rakshasa King. When we came to know, three days ago, from Sampathi news confirming your being here, we felt as happy as when seeing you before our eyes. Rama and Lakshmana are awaiting my return with the good tidings. If you permit me, I shall get back immediately and communicate to them news about your welfare.”<b4/>'
+ '&nbsp;&nbsp;Sita pleaded, “Hanuman! I do not know whether you will be back at this place or when. Please stay for a day more and delight me, by telling me about Rama and Lakshmana.” But since the demonesses gathered around in groups to carry out their separate assignments, Hanuman resumed his miniature size and hopped onto a branch of the tree.'
+ '<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sita sat under the tree, ruminating on all that Hanuman had related to her. She derived delight while doing so, and she cast her eyes showering benediction on Hanuman sitting on the branch above her head. That day, she had no thirst or hunger. She did not touch the fruits and drinks that the women-guards brought for her. Her pathetic condition hurt the kind heart of Hanuman. She appeared to him as the very picture of misery. Hanuman heard the harsh and sharp pointed words used by the women-guards, and he gnashed his teeth in anger, for he could not deal with them as he wished to. Sita alone could give him orders what to do.'

Keeping in mind the characteristics and excellences of Sita that Rama had described to him, he observed closely every woman in those houses; but he could not find Sita. In near despair, he jumped on a peak of a hill and thought over the situation, deeply, for long. “How can I go back to Rama, without completing my mission, meeting Sita and consoling her? Better to drown in the sea yonder. Alas, mine is a wasted life. Fie upon it,” he said to himself.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;'
+ 'That very instant, he saw a beautiful garden, trim and green, shining in the distance. Coming down the peak, he realized that since the garden was in a valley surrounded by tall mansions, he could not discover the  place from the ground. Not knowing what to do next, he hurried fast to the house of Vibhishana and discovered him immersed in reciting the Name of Rama. Seeing Hanuman, Vibhishana rose and approached him in a friendly and pleasing manner. He asked, “Hanuman! Did you see Sita?” Hanuman expressed his disappointment, but Vibhishana gave him the information. “Hanuman, there is in this City a garden named Asokavana. There, in the midst of terrible and mighty Rakshasas, Sita is kept. My wife and daughter are with her, doing service.” He also disclosed to him the route by which he could reach the garden and the spot. Hanuman could not stay a moment longer. He reached the garden in a trice. Jumping unnoticed from branch to branch, hiding himself behind clusters of leaves, he reached the Ashokavana.'
+ '<h4>Sita tortured in Ashokavana</h4>'
+ 'There he saw a woman, sitting under a tree, weak and worn, through want of food and sleep. The fierce Rakshasas sitting guard around her were threatening her, to change her will and to break her determination. Meanwhile, a grand cavalcade neared the place heralded by the beating of drums and the blowing of trumpets. Behind them Hanuman could see a royal personage, jeweled and robed in magnificent style. Hundreds of maidens followed him, carrying plates full of jewels, sweet and fragrant presents and soft silks. Ensconcing himself within the green shade of leaves, Hanuman watched the scene from the top of a nearby tree.'
+ '<br/>It was Ravana, evidently, for he pleaded before Sita and prayed to her that she might offer her love to him. He tried to extract a promise by threats of cruel  punishment. Hanuman heard him exhort those around him to inflict pain and injury on her. That frail feeble woman did not raise her eyes towards Ravana even once during all the tirade. She only said, “Fool! Vile vicious fellow! Rama alone has rights over me. No one other than Rama has any. I shall reduce this body to ashes in the flames of sorrow at separation from Him. I shall never stray from my resolve. Believe in this and beware!”<br/> Hanuman heard these emphatic words and realized that the woman was Sita and no other. His mind gained peace and calmness when he knew this.'
+ '<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Very soon, Ravana stung by disappointment and angry at the discomfiture, became even more violent in speech. He gave her a month’s respite, to think over and accede. The convoy and the maids with the plates also accompanied him out of the garden. When they had all left, Sita raised her head towards the heavens and sighed: “Rama! Has not compassion yet entered your heart? Why have you condemned me to this torture? When am I to be freed from this?” and she burst into weeping.'

He is proceeding on the mission of Rama. Ah, how lucky is he! He has the strength and intelligence necessary to win victory in that mission of Rama. He is indeed the foremost among the devotees of Rama.” The sea was boisterous with the joy it felt at the sight of Hanuman going over and across. The Mainaka Peak, which was submerged in the sea, rose over the waters, for he wished to serve the person who was engaged in the service of the Lord. He said, “Oh Son of the Wind-God! It will be exhausting for you to cover the full distance in one leap, please take rest for a while on my head and confer on me the good fortune of having a share in the service you are devoted to.” Hanuman gave ear to the prayer of Mainaka, but did not halt. He touched the peak as a token of halting and sped on. He bowed to the hospitable peak in gratitude. “Mainaka! I am going on Rama’s errand. Till I fulfil it, I can have no thought of rest or even food and drink. It is not proper for me to stay awhile on the way,” he said. A little further on, a Serpent-demon called Surasa and an Ogress named Simhika obstructed his passage, but Hanuman overcame them all and reached the Lanka shore.' +
'<h4>Aerial view of Lanka</h4>' +
'There, splendid in the sunlight, he found many gardens and parks as well as pleasure centers which made Hanuman forget where he was. He was amazed at the variety of multi-colored birds that fluttered to and fro in clusters within the parks. Hanuman climbed onto a charming mound that was nearby and thought within himself, “This success is not due to my skill or strength. It is entirely due to the Grace and Blessings of Rama only.” Seeing the uniquely grand houses, the long wide streets, the attractive gardens, etc., in that City, Hanuman was moved with wonder and doubt—doubt whether it was a replica of Heaven itself. Wherever one cast his eye, one saw well-built Rakshasa soldiers parading the streets, Rakshasa women, famed for their skill and powers to assume whatever form they wanted were found by Hanuman indulging in licentious sports. Hanuman concluded that it would not be wise to move about in his native form among the vast crowds that filled the streets. He assumed a subtle imperceptible form and entered the City.'
                     +  '<h4>Hanuman Stopped at the entrance</h4>' +
'There was at the very entrance gate of Lanka a demoness, named Lankini, placed there on purpose to prevent any foreigner, whatever his intentions may be, from entering the City. She saw the strange figure of Hanuman, venturing to enter and accosted him in a threatening manner. “Who goes there? Where do you come from? Who are you? We have never before seen such a creature in this region. You could not have come from outside the bounds of Lanka, for Lanka is surrounded by the sea. Ah! did you, by any means, come across the sea? How can you avoid me and enter the City? Halt! Stop where you are!”' 
+ '<h4>Lankini blessed, with a blow!</h4>'
+ 'Hanuman paid no attention to her words. He moved forward slowly, dragging his tail behind him as if he had not eard her threats. Lankini became even more furious and ferocious. She roared in anger, “Oh, ill-fated fool! Do not my words fall on your ears?” Hanuman brushed aside her protests and questions. He walked towards the gate, with a smile on his face. Lankini shouted, “Ugly beast! Whoever goes against my orders will be eaten up. Remember, I will chew your bones in seconds. Be warned.” She rushed forward to catch the tiny monkey that Hanuman had become, while he sought to enter Lanka City. When she came right in front of him, Hanuman tightened his little fist and hit her a mighty blow. She rolled unconscious on the ground. Blood flowed in streams from her mouth. She recovered after a while and rushed madly forward to catch hold of Hanuman. But when Hanuman dealt another blow, she could not bear the impact. She fell and could not rise again. But she managed to sit up after great struggle, and with folded palms, she supplicated, “Oh Person of wonderful Form! Long ago, when Brahma, the first of the Trinity, was turning away from Ravana, after granting him many boons, he faced him all of a sudden and said, ‘The day your Guardian of the Gate is fatally hurt by a blow from a monkey’s hand, know that your downfall begins. Your powers can no longer help you. Be warned by that incident that death is drawing near. That monkey will enter Lanka at the command of God for fulfilling His Mission. His arrival heralds the destruction of the Rakshasas. Be conscious of this.’ You are the messenger indicated. How fortunate that my body was sanctified by contact with your sacred hand! Ah! How soft and thrilling was the blow you gave me.” Saying thus, she fondled the spot where Hanuman had hit her.' 
+ '<h4>Hanuman sees a holy place</h4>'
+ 'Meanwhile, paying no heed to her words, unmoved by praise and unconcerned with blame, Hanuman entered Lanka, repeating “Rama” “Rama” “Rama” with every breath. Still a thought tormented him. Who would give him the clue about where Sita was? How to identify Sita when one sees her? He adopted a subtle form to escape notice and moved from one treetop to another. He roamed in the bazaars and among groups of Rakshasas, unknown to anyone. Suddenly, his eyes fell upon a building that seemed a temple of Hari (Vishnu). It had a garden of Tulsi plants all around it. Over the entrance door, the name Hari was carved beautifully. The house was undoubtedly a Temple of God Vishnu. Hanuman was surprised. “How came the name of Hari over this door?” he wondered, “Surely, this is a holy spot,” he decided.' 
+ '<h4>Hanuman meets Vibhishana</h4>'
+ 'The curiosity of Hanuman was awakened. He jumped on to the roof of that place and peeped through the window to find out what exactly was happening.<br/> Just at that moment, a person was stretching his limbs prior to rising from bed, pronouncing the name of Hari. When that fell on his ears, Hanuman was extremely delighted. He was also emboldened when he knew that even in Lanka there were people reciting the name of Hari. '
+ '<br/>So he felt like searching for Sita with greater courage and less apprehension. “The man of this house appears to be devout and good. Perhaps, he may be able to tell me the whereabouts of Sita. He might be persuaded to befriend me since we are both loyal to the selfsame form of God.” With this idea, Hanuman changed himself into a priest of the Brahmin caste, and made his entrance into that house.'
+ '<br/> Though for a moment he had some doubt regarding the stranger, Vibhishana, the owner of the house, decided that, whoever he is, he surely must be honored since he was a Brahmin. So he came forward and prostrated before Hanuman. “Master! which is your native place? Where are you coming from? How could you avoid being noticed and harassed by the Rakshasas in the streets?” Vibhishana asked. He described to his guest the horrors indulged in by the Rakshasas and extolled the audacity and fearlessness of Hanuman. Hanuman replied, “I am a servant of Hari. My name is Hanuman. I have come because Rama sent me,” and he spoke thereafter of the virtues and excellences of Rama in some detail.'
+ '<br/> Hanuman noticed that while he was describing Rama, tears rolled down the cheeks of Vibhishana. “Oh, what a happy day! How great is my fortune! As soon as I rose from bed, I could hear today these glorious words which bring peace and joy,” thought Vibhishana to himself.'

                      content: '||Om Shree Sai Ram||<br/>||Sri Ram Jayam<br/>' +
                                '<i>[<u>Story in Brief</u>: Rama, Sita and Lakshmana (Rama’s brother) were living in a forest leading a simple life. Sita was fascinated by a golden deer there and sent Rama to get it. Rama chased the deer for a while and shot an arrow at it. It cried,“Lakshmana” in great agony. Sita sent Lakshmana to help Rama. At that moment, Sita was kidnapped by Ravana and he took her to Sri Lanka in his flying chariot.  The bird Jatayu tried to stop him, but Ravana clipped its wings. Sita looked down and saw a group of monkeys atop a hill. She removed all her ornaments, tore a portion of her saree, wrapped the jewels in it and threw the bundle amidst the monkeys. Ravana kept Sita in his royal chamber with guards and hoped that one day Sita would agree to be his queen.<br/>&nbsp;' +
                                'When Rama and Lakshmana returned to their hut, they found Sita missing.  Rama was heart-broken and life seemed meaningless to him without Sita. The two brothers started searching for Sita and reached Rishyamukha hill.  There, they became friends with Sugriva, who was the leader of the monkey herd. Rama narrated his story to Sugriva and asked for his help in locating Sita. Sugriva shows Rama the bundle of jewels that fell from a flying chariot. Sugriva promises to help Rama in finding Sita.]' +
                                '<h4>Sugriva asks for time</h4>' +
'Sugriva held a conference of leaders and announced that, since the season was late autumn, rains were imminent and the monkey hordes would be hard put to it to move about in the cold and in the storm. So he suggested that as soon as the autumn passed, they must set about the task of searching for the place where Sita was. He presented this information to Rama and Lakshmana also. Rama realized the truth of these statements and he acceded to the proposal. The brothers retired to the Rishyamukha Hill and took residence there.' +
'<h4>Spring dawns and the search begins</h4>' +
'The rains finally stopped. The spring season dawned on the world. The earth shone resplendently green. Grass sprouted everywhere and soon the earth decked itself with many-colored floral dress. Greed weakens when gladness grows. The mind is rendered pure and pellucid when desire and delusion disappear. So too, the rivers were rendered clear and clean. Rama told Lakshmana, “Brother, it is desirable to give a warning to Sugriva now.” Lakshmana paid heed to that command, and requested Hanuman, who was a daily visitor to the hermitage, to remind Sugriva of the promised task. Hanuman was most earnest and anxious to fulfil the orders of Rama. So he warned Sugriva immediately and effectively. He called together the leaders of the monkey hordes and initiated the arrangements. Sugriva gave everyone the determination and courage needed for the execution of the task assigned. Urged by the resolution that the mission must succeed, he sent them to all the four quarters. He entrusted the overall leadership to Hanuman himself. Led by Hanuman, the entire assembly of monkeys shouted, “Jai” to Sugriva and “Jai” to Rama, the Lord. Dancing and jumping in glee, the monkeys hurried on their different demarcated paths, inspired by Hanuman and the holiness of the mission.' +
'<h4>Monkeys’ despair</h4>' +
'One day, during their journey, the monkeys sank in gloom and sighed, “Alas, of the period allotted to us by our Master, Sugriva, only two days remain. And we have not traced Sita!” Angada and the rest lamented their fate and were lost in despair. Tears rolled down their cheeks. They had come to the shore of the sea and were sad that not one of them could cross it to continue the search. So, they sat in groups on the sands and were pining in disappointment.' +
'<h4>Sampati gives a hint</h4>' +
'At this time, a bird walked amidst them and started speaking. It said, “Monkeys! My name is Sampathi. Jatayu and I are brothers. Oh, Vanaras (monekys)! One day, when I was afflicted with uncontrollable hunger, I called my son, Suparna, to my side and told him,‘Son, fly quickly. Get me some food. I am old. I am hungry.’ Seeing my plight, he flew into the forest, but did not return quickly. At last, he appeared with some quantity of venison. I asked him, ‘Why did it take so long? My son caught hold of my feet in supplication and said, ‘Father, I did not waste a single moment while away. Please listen to my prayer.’ He said, ‘When I was flying into the forest a person with twenty hands and ten heads was hurrying along. With him was a woman of indescribable beauty. She was weeping and wailing most pitiably. I knew it was a monster, and so I attacked him and saw the woman inside the chariot. She was crying out just one Name, Rama! Rama! Rama! No other word emerged from her mouth. My futile attempts to stop his progress and to save that woman caused this delay.’<br/>' +
' Immediately, I exclaimed, ‘Alas! That monster is Ravana and that woman is the Divine Mother, Sita!’ Sampati said, “Oh Vanaras! The City of Lanka is situated on the Triple-Peak-Hill by the shore of the sea. That City has many charming gardens and parks. There, Sita is in the Asokavana, moaning her fate. She is awaiting your arrival. So, proceed further south. Oh Vanaras, you can achieve success in the task allotted to you by Rama if there is one among you who has the strength and the skill to leap a distance of 100 yojanas (800 miles).”' +
'<h4>Who can jump across the ocean?</h4>' +
'Angada looked around, and looking at Hanuman, he said, “Oh Son of the Wind-God, you are the dedicated servant of Rama. Your devotion is indeed deep. You were blessed first among all of us with the Darshan of Rama. Through your intelligence, diplomacy and moral pressure, you established friendship between Rama and our ruler, Sugriva. And now, you are observing silence, when we are involved with difficulties in the execution of the mission of Rama. I find it difficult to understand the meaning of this silence.”' +

If the light is behind the mirror, can you see yourself? No, the light has to shine on you first so that the light that is reflected from you when it strikes the mirror produces the image. Similarly, according to the sages, there are three things in the world. God, Nature and I. Man and everything came from God. God when seen through the mirror of Nature appears as I.  Remove the mirror; the image disappears and merges with the Original; then there is only God. Man is but the image of God. Even nature is but an appearance of God; the reality is He alone. The multitude of manifestations in the world which deludes man comes from the mirror called Maya.<br/><br/>' +
                     'When the image is conceived as distinct from you, we have dualism, Dwaitham. When it is recognized as only an unreal image, but, when given some relevance to it, because it is related to the Original, then it is called Qualified Non-dualism (Vishishta-adwaitham). When both the ‘I’ image and the mirror are recognized as illusions and dismissed as such, and the ultimate One Reality is recognized, we have Adwaitham. The search for One, without a Second is the basis of Vedanta and all spiritual practices. ',

This means that you are now transcending the three gunas of diverse worldly attributes and proceeding towards the knowledge of Unity. The thumb represents Brahman. Now, slowly pass each bead with the tip of the thumb towards you. When the bead passes over, the mergence with Brahman is emphasized with every bead, every breath while the tongue too repeats a mantra or name of the Lord. The Japamala is very useful for the beginners in Sadhana, but as you progress, Japa must become the very breath of your life and the Japamala should become superfluous. The safety float has to be discarded when you have learnt to swim, the crutches when you are able to walk. Always, at all times, in all places, the Lord has to be meditated upon.',

It is immutable because it always adds up to 9.  So, when you turn the beads, impress upon yourself the fact that Unity behind all the beads (the string) and there is Truth and travesty in the world, travesty attracts, distracts and deceives you; and Truth makes you free!',
