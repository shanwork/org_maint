Desire is of two kinds: the noble and the base. The base desires are lust and greed. Noble desire is directed towards enlightenment and emancipation.  Base desire contaminates and clouds the understanding. Sadhana is easy for the aspirant who is endowed with noble desires. Calmness is the criterion of spiritual progress.

There are people in this world, who are so poor that they don’t have any food to eat. There are people who are very rich and have a lot of food in the fridge. Yet they can’t eat; they starve. Do you know why? They are dieting! (Everyone laughs) The message is that neither should you starve nor eat too much.

It refers to the wisdom which exists in the midst of ignorance. Wisdom and ignorance are not two different things; they are essentially the same, opposite polarities of the same underlying principle. The state that transcends both wisdom and ignorance is Divinity (Paratatva). This Shivarathri is a day when one tries to establish friendship between mind and God. Shivarathri reminds everyone of the fact that Divinity is all pervasive and is to be found everywhere. It is said that Shiva lives in Kailasa. But where is Kailasa? Kailasa is our own mind full of joy and bliss. It means that when you develop purity, steadiness and sacredness from within, your heart becomes filled with peace and bliss and ultimately your heart itself becomes Kailasa.<p/>' +
                 ' Scriptures proclaim that Maha Shivarathri is very auspicious time to worship Lord Shiva. Performing Abhisheka to Shivalingam with Panchamruthams (Milk, Buttermilk, Ghee, Honey, Sugar, and Fruits) while chanting Sri Rudram pleases Lord Shiva the most. Staying awake throughout the night (Jagarana) and worshipping Lord Shiva is particularly pleasing to Him.  One has to worship Lord Shiva to achieve salvation and that too on Shivarathri day. It is certain that one who keeps awake on this day will attain Shiva Sayujyam (becoming one with Lord Shiva). It is believed that the devotee\'s sincere worship of Lord Shiva on this auspicious night will absolve past sins and enable salvation. ',

Suppose a chest of treasures is immersed in the Ganges with one end attached to a chain, which is fixed on the bank. Following the chain, link by link, you can dive into the water and gradually trace your way to the treasure chest. In the same manner, if you become absorbed in the repetition of the His holy name, you will eventually realize Him.',

There may be a few exceptional persons who can stand aside and give up the world, as a snake casts off its skin and stands aside and looks at it. There is no doubt, these are exceptional beings. But the rest of us have to go slowly through the world of work (Karma). Karma Yoga shows the process, the secret and the method of doing it to the best of our advantage.',

 '<p>Krishna was the eighth son of Devaki and Vasudeva. The fetus of the seventh son Balarama was transferred to the womb of Rohini and he was brought up in Gokul. Devaki’s father was Devaka and his elder brother Ugrasena was ruling over Mathura. Ugrasena had nine sons and Kamsa was the eldest son. Kamsa had no sisters of his own and so he loved Devaki as his dearest self. Kamsa imprisoned his father Ugrasena and installed himself as the King of Mathura.</p><p>Jarasandha ruled over Magadha. He gave his two daughters Asti and Prapti in marriage to Kamsa. Krishna killed Kamsa in a fight and restored the crown to Ugrasena. Krishna refused to take the crown, handed over Mathura to Ugrasena and went back to Dwaraka. Jarasandha hated Krishna because both his daughters were widowed by Krishna.</p><p>Jarasandha’s friend Damaghosha was a king of Chedi. He was very cruel and a stubborn King. (Dama means curbing down. Ghosha means famous. So, he was famous for curbing down and controlling his citizens.) He had a son Sishupala who will be the crown prince of Chedi. Damaghosha loved his son so much that he would many perform many rituals to invoke good fortune on him.</p>' +
 '<h4>Rukmi brings the news</h4><p>Bheeshmaka was the King of Vidharba. He had five sons and only one daughter. The first son was Rukmi and the youngest daughter was Rukmini. She was very beautiful and was at the right age to be married. Narada used to visit Bhishmaka’s palace often and from their conversations she had heard many good things about Krishna. Slowly, Rukmini started thinking of Krishna and began to dote on Krishna.</p><p>Rukmini’s brother Rukmi was always in bad company and he was very friendly with Kamsa and  Jarasandha. Rukmi brought the news to Bheeshmaka that the cowherd boy Krishna had slain Kamsa.<br/>Rukmini said, “He is not a cowherd boy. He is a noble Yadava.”<br/>Rukmi snapped immediately, “Rukmini, he has killed my friend and you call him noble?”<br/>“Don’t forget! Kamsa was cruel. He imprisoned his own father and usurped the throne”, shouted Rukmini.<br/>Bheeshmaka interrupted, “I assume Krishna will now become the King of Mathura.”<br/>Rukmi said, “No. Krishna refused the crown and Ugrasena was re-instated.”<br/>Rukmini cut him short, “Don’t you see! How noble Krishna is?”<br/>“How did Jarasandha react?” asked Bheeshmaka.<br/>Rukmi replied, “He is furious. He vows to take revenge. He has sent word for me. I must go and see him.”</p>' +
 '<h4>Rukmini longs for Krishna</h4><p>All this news and incidents made Rukmini’s love for Krishna even stronger. Bheeshmaka and his wife also felt that Krishna was the most suitable groom for Rukmini.<br/>Meanwhile, Jarasandha with Rukmi and his allies made several attempts to kill Krishna but in vain. After the eighteenth attempt, they decided to bide their time and go back to their capitals.<br/>In Dwaraka, Balarama broke the news: “Krishna, we have come to know that Jarasandha has decided to lie low for a while. Now, you will have some time to think of the beautiful princess of Vidharba!”<br/>“Balarama! Somehow, I have also developed love for Rukmini. I am thinking of her all the time! My mind is also set on marrying her. But her brother Rukmi is a staunch ally of Jarasandha.”<br/>At the same time, in Vidharba, Rukmini too was lost in the dreams of Krishna hugging her (when the Lord thinks of His devotee, the devotee also thinks of Him!). She thought, “Even with Rukmi and his allies, Jarasandha could not vanquish Krishna. You are great, Krishna! You and only You shall be my Lord!”<p><h4>To be continued….</h4>',

Krishna has killed Jarasanda’s son-in-law, Kamsa. We cannot afford to displease this mighty emperor.”Bheeshmaka’s face dropped: “But, we cannot think of a better husband for Rukmini.”Rukmi said, “My friend Sishupala, the crown prince of Chedi is enamored of Rukmini.  He will be the best person to marry her.”Bheeshmaka was not at all happy about it but he had to yield to his eldest son’s decisions. Not only that, he was getting old and he could not think of ways to bring Krishna and Rukmini together. He said, “All right Rukmi, do as you will!”Rukmi said, “Then, I shall send a proposal to the King of Chedi and invite Sishupala to come and marry Rukmini.”Rukmini who was walking in the garden, overheard their conversation and was deeply upset. She thought, “How can my brother force me to marry someone whom I don’t like?” Meanwhile, Rukmi started making arrangements for Rukmini’s marriage with Sishupala.</p>' +
 '<h4>Rukmni sends a love letter</h4><p>Suddenly, a thought occurred to Rukmini.“Why not I approach Krishna? After all, my parents are for it.”She went into the palace to her room and sent word for Sunanda, a brahmin whom she trusted and who was also kind to her.Sunanda walked in and said surprisingly, “Why do you look so pale dear? What is the matter?”Rukmini told him about the conversation she had overheard and asked him, “Is it wrong to send a secret message to Krishna?”Sunanda replied, “No dear! It would be very wrong to marry Sishupala if your heart is set on another. Moreover, your parents have approved Krishna and their hearts are set on Him.”Rukmini asked him, “With whom can I entrust such a sacred message?”“Don’t worry dear one! I shall carry the message for you.”Rukmini took a banana leaf and wrote a message on it using  her nails and gave it to Sunanda saying, “Be sure to tell Krishna that my kith and kin should not be killed on my account.” Sunanda assured that he would do so.</p>' +
 '<h4>Krishna reads the letter</h4><p>With great difficulty, Sunanda reached Dwaraka and met Krishna. Krishna welcomed him, seated him and said, “O venerable one, please tell me why have you come this far?”Sunanda said, “Dear Lord, I have come with a message from Rukmini, the princess of Vidarbha!”Sunanda described Rukmini’s dilemma and gave the message to Krishna. Krishna lovingly received the banana leaf from the hands of Sunanda and started reading the message:“Lord, I have chosen You as my husband. Please come to Vidarbha, vanquish the armies of Jarasandha and Sishupla and take me with you. On the day of the marriage, I will be first taken to the Durga temple for worship. It will be a good place for you to kidnap me from there.”<br/>After reading the message, Krishna looked at Sunanda."If you do not come and take her away, she has decided to give up her life!”, said Sunanda.<br/>Krishna replied, “I know… I know. Little does she know that I too have set my heart on winning her! But Rukmi will not give her to me.”<br/>Sunanda’s face fell, “That means…. you will not take her….”<br/>“No. No. Now that she has revealed her heart to me, I shall make her mine. I shall vanquish anyone who comes in my way”, said Krishna.<br/>At this point, Sunanda interrupted, “The little girl wants to make sure that there is no blood-shed on her account.” Krishna nodded His head in approval, gave gifts to Sunanda and sent him home.</p>' +
 '<h4>Krishna heads to Vidarbha/Jarasandha plans</h4><p>Krishna called his charioteer Daruka and asked him to get ready. Krishna told him to inform Balarama that he was proceeding to Vidarbha. Meanwhile, Rukmi’s formal proposal and invitation reached Sishupala. Sishupala was very jubilant because there was no Swayamvara (bride choosing the husband). All he has to do was, go to Vidarbha marry Rukmini and bring her home. It was that easy.. but Jarasandha was not confident. He knew that the vile cowherd could cause some trouble if he comes to know of this news. Jarasandha sent for all his vassals and allies to be ready in Vidarbha to confront Krishna, if he comes to take away the bride.  Balarama became aware of this news and marched towards Vidarbha with his armies, elephants, horses and chariots.</p>'
 + '<h4>Rukmini’s anxiety builds up</h4><p>At Vidarbha, Rukmini’s anxiety was building up every moment. She thought, “Has Krishna felt disgusted with my message that I have no shame in asking him to be my husband? Then, why has Sunanda not come back?” As she started looking at the window for the hundredth time, she saw Sunanda entering the palace. She quickly ran to the door to meet Sunanda. Sunanda briefed her, “Krishna has come dear! Everything is going according to the plan. Balarama too has come with his forces” and left the palace in a hurry.</p>' +
 '<h4>Rukmini heads to Durga’s shrine</h4><p>“Rukmini, your chariot has arrived. Are you ready?”, shouted one of the maids. Rukmini was dressed nicely and she got into the chariot. She was taken to the temple courtyard where she stepped down. Many Kings had assembled there. From there, she looked for Krishna and thought, “I don’t see Krishna among them. They say that he is dark blue, wears a yellow robe and sports a peacock feather in his crown.” She entered the temple, washed the feet of Goddess Durga, and placed flowers at her feet. Overcome by anxiety and emotion, she prayed, “O Goddess Durga, please let Krishna and only Krishna win and marry me. O Durga, please do not disappoint me.” As she walked towards the gate, her eyes scanned the assembly of Kings again,  looking for Krishna. She murmured, “Will Krishna ever come and rescue me?”</p>'

Krishna then killed Rukmi’s horses with his arrows and then shattered his chariot. Mad with rage, Rukmi took his sword and rushed towards Krishna. Krishna picked up his sword and was ready to fight.

Your brother has reaped the fruits of his own actions.” Humiliated and insulted, Rukmi walked away saying, “I can’t return to the capital now. It is a shame.”</p>' +

The inhabitants of Dwaraka City were so pleased that they dressed themselves with nicest garments and ornaments and went to present gifts, according to their means, to the newly married couple. All the houses of Dwaraka were decorated with flags, festoons and flowers.  The whole city became fragrant by burning of fine incense. At night, there was illumination from thousands of lamps, which decorated every building. The Goddess of fortune Rukmini, was finally united with the Lord Krishna and all the people of Dwaraka felt extremely jubilant.',

Narada came in the disguise of a physician and prescribed that if somebody can give his or her feet’s dust washed and give that water for Krishna to drink, he will be cured. Otherwise, he will die. When Krishna asked Rukmini and Sathyabhama for the ‘dust water’ they started cried saying that it will the highest sin because Krishna is their husband, as well as God.<p/> When Krishna approached Radha and the other Gopis, they were ready to offer their ‘dust water’. When Krishna warned them that they will be committing the greatest sin, they simply smiled and said that they would rather go to hell than lose their dear Krishna. The Lord craves for the ‘dust’ from the feet of the devotees because it is very auspicious. Then, what to speak of the Bhakta? Don’t you feel that you are blessed to have such a nice name, like Renu?',

'<p>A gray Porche 911 raced into Stevenson Blvd in Fremont and made a sharp right turn into Liberty Street. All the kids dropped their toys and bats, left their tricycles and ran to their homes for safety. A dust cloud followed the car whenever the engine revved up, with random crunching of coke cans and empty water bottles on the street. It appeared as though the car was on a re-entry path from space, not going to stop anywhere, when it suddenly made a sharp 90 degree turn into a drive-way but came to screeching stop with just one inch to spare the garage door. The care rocked back and forth from this sudden braking. All the moms with their kids stood on their drive ways and watched this Nascar show and sighed, “The speed queen has arrived.”</p><br>' +
'<p>   A few seconds later, the driver’s side door opened and out came a slim leg with high heels. Next, a very fashionable and modern figure in a three piece suit emerged, carrying a laptop, a smart phone and a leather bag full of office documents. The woman, at last, ducked her head and pulled her hand bag from the passenger’s seat and slammed the door shut. The clock, unable to bear the shock, moved forward by a minute and said 6:49. Then there was the ‘tick tack’ of the high-heels for a while, walking on the cement. It stopped when her hand opened the front door which always remained unlocked.</p><br>' +
'<p> The door was shut behind. Carefully holding all the things in one hand, she removed her high-heels and flung them to one corner of the house. As she was walking towards her room, she could hear the coughing of an old man from the other room. Dropping everything on the table, she went into the kitchen, took out something from the fridge and put it in the microwave. The box said ‘Lean Cuisine’.  After the microwave beeped, she took the food to her room with a drink. When she was about to put the food in the mouth, there was a loud shout from the other room, “Beti, Did you pray to Baba?” Rhea retorts from her room, “Dad, you say work is worship. I have been worshipping my work all day. Allow me to eat in peace.” Rhea flipped through all the channels on the TV and found that there was nothing worth watching. Quickly gulping the food, she started going through all the office papers she had brought home.</p><br>' +
'<p>     Rhea has a B.S in Mechanical Engineering from UCLA and a MBA from UCLA Anderson School of Management. She worked as a Senior Director of Corporate Loans at Bank of America in San Francisco for many years. She was tired of commuting by BART. She wanted to work some place where she could drive her Porche to work and show off. For the past three years, she has been with C-Gate in Fremont as VP of Finance. She is bright, sharp and clever and she can out-smart you in any conversation. Once, for the Diwali function, at her father’s persistence, she wore a saree. The blouse she wore had a very low back. One of her friends came to her and said, “Rhea, you are a very forward and modern girl exposing so much of your back.” Rhea snapped, “You say, I am forward! I am very backward. I don’t show my front. I insult men by showing my back.”</p><br>' +
'<p>     Tomorrow is her day. She has made a deal to buy Solar-Indra and their world-class manufacturing facility in Fremont that overlooks 880. She has to be at work by 7:00AM the next day, to be in the conference call with JP Morgan Chase, Citi Bank and Merrill Lynch to close the deal. All the big shots from both C-Gate and Solar-Indra will be there. This will be a major step for Rhea. It will help her realize her life-long ambition to become a Senior VP or CFO of C-Gate.</p><br>' +
'<p>       The alarm went off at 5:30AM. Hitting the Snooze button Rhea slept for some more time. She got dressed very nicely with fine clothes and showed a ‘little’ to attract the men of power. Sipping a cup of tea, she put all the papers back into the leather bag and got ready to load it into the car. It was a Thursday in winter and it was already late. As she got out of her room, her dad was walking in the hall way chanting ‘Sai Ram, Sai Ram’. He looked at Rhea and said,</p><br>' +
'<p>“Why do you dress like a street girl?”</p><br>' +
'<p> “Yes, I am a street girl. Wall Street girl! You don’t know anything about management.”</p><br>' +
'<p>“Your mom couldn’t manage you. That is why she passed away when you were a teen-ager.”</p><br>' +
'<p>Rhea had no time to respond. She had to be out of the house soon.</p><br>' +
'<p>She was racing to get to Kato Road. There was a dense fog and the visibility was just a few feet. The traffic on Dixon Landing was bad due to the BART construction and it had backed up all the way to 880. When she was at the signal on Dixon Landing Road at California Circle, she thought she could make a right at California Circle to bypass the through traffic on Dixon Landing, make it through Milmont Drive and get to Kato Road. This could save a few minutes. So, she quickly made a right turn into California Circle and was speeding as there was no traffic.</p><br>' +
'<p>                 As she was driving through, she came across a bridge. Right at the bridge, it appeared as though a brown leaf was being blown away by the wind from left to right. She sped through it and suddenly, there was a ‘thud’!    -to be continued</p><br>',

'<p>Rhea could see a man dressed in white clothes being hit by the car. He was limping and making his way to the walk way on the right.</p><br>' +
'<p>“Shoot! Who is this idiot? Oh my God, my meeting is finished!”</p><br>' +
'<p>She stopped the car right there, turned on the emergency blinkers and stepped out to help him.</p><br>' +
'<p>“Are you OK? Were you hurt badly?</p><br>' +
'<p>“It is OK. A slight bruise on my right knee and a few drops of blood.”</p><br>' +
'<p>“Shall I take you to the hospital?”</p><br/><p>“No! No! I don’t want to miss my Arati.”</p><br><p>Rhea’s mind went reeling! “It is not even 7:00AM. He is dating Arati at this hour! I thought I was modern. What has the world come to?”</p></br><p>“OK, I will drop where your Arati is waiting.”</p></br><p>“No, Thank you. I will walk. All this is….(he was choked with emotions) His doing!”</p></br>' +
'<p>Rhea thought that he didn’t feel safe in her car anymore. As he was walking by, she saw that he was wearing white pants and a white shirt. He was carrying a white back pack, he had his white shoes on his left hand and he was walking bare footed! She couldn’t help notice that in the back pack, something was stuffed in the last minute and it was hanging out of the partly zipped back pocket. The elastic band had a name ‘Jockey’. Rhea couldn’t control herself. She murmured, “Oh My God, The world has changed so much! He is dating Arati and he is carrying extra under garments!” She quickly got back into her car and drove off to work. She thanked her good luck that this didn’t turn into a law suit.</p><br>' +
'<p>Everything went well with the video conference and the deal was done. Everyone congratulated Rhea on how she had meticulously orchestrated the whole deal. Slowly, everyone left the conference room except for a few. The CEO of C-Gate, Scott Brown patted Rhea on her right shoulder and pulled her to one side and said, “Meet Mr. Hakim. He is the Senior VP of Operations at Solar-Indra.”</p><br>' +
'<p>Hakim stretched his hand, “I am Hakimrai Jaichand” and shook Rhea’s hand. Rhea replied, “Chandnani, Rhea Chandnani. Nice to meet you!” (Rhea always introduced herself in James Bond style, “Bond, James Bond”). Brown continued, “Hakim will be with us for a few more months before he retires. I want you to spend all the time with him to understand how the factory operates, the machinery, tools, facilities, maintenance, safety, plant drawings etc., so that we can convert it for our operations. Your mechanical engineering skills will become handy now.” Hakim and Rhea agreed that starting next Monday, they would meet at the factory to go over all the details.</p><br>' +
'<p> The next week, Rhea showed up at the plant at 8:00. It was a huge building which was totally empty of any workers. The company had gone belly-up. All the machines were turned off and it was very quiet. There were only three people….Rhea, Hakim and Steve, a senior technician to help them with any technical issues related to the factory. There was a big office on the second floor with complete glass windows which overlooked the factory floor. One could tell from there what was happening in the factory floor at any given moment. Hakim and Rhea were the lone occupants of this huge office space and Steve was always running errands for them and also to attend to the needs of the building.</p><br>' +
'<p>Rhea being a gregarious, fashionable and always out-going person, this deafening silence bothered her. But, she has to do it if she wants to climb the corporate ladder. Every day, she would come in at 8:00 and notice that Hakim was already there having brewed the first pot of coffee. She would leave around 5:00 and Hakim would still continue to work. What a dedicated person Hakim must be!</p><br>' +
'<p> Slowly, they go to know each other. Hakim began to like her company in the office. Rhea was tall 5’ 8”, slim, well dressed with brimming youth and pleasant manners. Hakim came to know that Rhea was not a coffee person. She liked Chai Latte. Sometimes, Hakim would take Rhea to Starbucks on Dixon Landing near Chevron and buy her a Chai Latte and chat on some personal matters. They would go out to lunch together and chat about their experiences in their jobs as well as previous jobs. -to be continued</p><br>'

Once again, due to the heavy traffic on Dixon Landing, she took the California Circle to bypass the traffic. As she was driving past BAPS Swami Narayan Mandir on the left, she saw a man, dressed totally in white entering a building on the right. He looked like the same man she had an accident with some time ago. If he was the same person, out of curiosity, she wanted to find out whether he was doing well. As she turned, she noticed a sign ‘SHIRDI SAI PARIVAAR’. She quickly got out of the car and entered the building so that she could meet him before he disappeared into the building. There he was, coming out of the ‘Shoe Room’ bare footed again. Rhea stopped him at the Shoe Room and asked him:</p><br>' +
'<p>“Do you remember me?”</p></br><p>“Yes. I do..Oh ..that accident!”</p></br><p>“Are you alright after the accident?”</p></br><p>“Yes, I am fine. He takes care of me all the time!” and he pointed towards the idol of Baba in the Main Hall. Rhea looked at the idol of Baba and there were no emotions in her heart. She looked at her watch to see when she can break out of that conversation. The man continued:</p></br>' +
'<p>“You are in time for Kakad Arati. Would you like to join?”</p></br><p>“Yes!” Rhea wondered as to what made her say ‘Yes’. She continued:</p></br><p>“What is your name?”</p></br><p>“I am Sunil Khare and You?”</p></br><p>“Chandnani. Rhea Chandnani”</p></br><p>“Are you from Mumbai?”</p></br><p>“Yes”</p></br>' +
'<p>“I am from Mumbai too. We will talk later. Let us go in and have Darshan.”</p><br>' +
'<p>Rhea followed Sunil like a sheep with a bent head. She was wondering why she has become so obedient to a stranger, almost following his tail. Rhea saw that there were more than 30 people in the early hours of the morning worshipping a marble idol of an old man they lovingly called Baba. There were two brass signs on the wall inscribed ‘Faith’ and ‘Patience’. Rhea froze and stood still like a pillar. There was an aura of peace and tranquility, though the speakers were blasting off with some songs accompanied by drums which she could not understand. They were pouring water on the idol, wiping and dressing the idol etc. At some point, all the women were called to hold a plate with 5 lamps to wave it in front of Baba. She did that ritual and came out. She looked at her watch, it was already 8:15! She thought, “What am I doing here?” Just then, Sunil came to her, took her to the kitchen so that she can eat something before leaving the place.  Rhea asked Sunil:</p><br>' +
'<p>She stopped the car right there, turned on the emergency blinkers and stepped out to help him.</p><br>' +
'<p>“When can I meet you again?”</p><br><p>“Same time, same place every day. If we have to meet again, He will make it happen”</p><br><p>Rhea waved at Sunil and dashed off to work. She was wondering who is ‘He’?</p><br>' +
'<p>  Months rolled by. One day, during lunch, Rhea asked Hakim as to how he is could work such long hours. This hit Hakim very hard at his heart.  He said, “Rhea, I am sorry to share this with you. I am divorced. I have nothing else to do. I am tired of playing golf all the time. My two daughters are married and well settled. My ex-wife is in Seattle. I have a retirement home in Phoenix. I am currently renting a place in Milpitas. Once I retire from here, I go straight to Phoenix and see how long I can sustain myself in that house, all alone. I don’t have any friends in Phoenix. Also, at my age, it is difficult to find people who have similar interests.” Rhea felt sorry that her question exposed the sad side of Hakim.</p><br>' +
'<p> Rhea learnt a lot from Hakim during the three months she was with him in the factory.  Both had developed a 420 page document that showed the plan as to which tools they have to keep, which tools they have to sell and which tools they have to buy and install so that they can turn the factory to make C-Gate’s products. It was now time for Hakim to retire as his last Friday was coming up. Rhea wanted to take him to dinner and bid him farewell. She had chosen a very nice Italian restaurant in San Jose.</p></br>' +
'<p> Hakim drove her to the restaurant and they both enjoyed the fine Italian spirits and the gourmet Italian cuisine. Hakim said that he feels very lonely because the only thing that he was holding onto was his job and it is also gone now. He has to transition now into retirement.  He said that he needed a week to clean up and vacate his apartment and that would make him even more miserable. Rhea could see the slight tears in his eyes and she felt sorry for him. Hakim then held Rhea’s both hands and said, “Rhea, I have got to know you during the past three months. You are a very smart and intelligent girl and you can pick up things very quickly and become good at it. You are an asset to C-Gate. I will talk to Scott Brown and strongly recommend that you be promoted to Senior VP of Operations and Finance. But, I need a small favor from you. You helped me clean up the Solar-Indra facility. Can you please stay with me for one week to help with packing and clean-up? Will you please help me with my transition to retirement?” -to be continued</p><br>',

Though many top executives had flirted with her once in a while, nobody had made such bold advances. She thought to herself, “Hakim will recommend me for promotion only if I help him with his lonely transition. Otherwise, he wouldn’t recommend me. What about all the hard work that I have put in for the past three months? He wants a personal favor from me to help my career. How mean can he be?”</p><br>' +
'<p> Rhea cut short the conversation and told Hakim that she had to go home immediately to take care her father because it was getting late for his medications. She didn’t want to take a ride from Hakim. Instead, she called a cab, went straight to work, picked up her car went home. It was a restless night. Somehow Hakim’s actions bothered her to the root. She wanted to talk to someone about it and let off her steam. Rhea didn’t have any close friends with whom she could confide.The only person that came to her mind was Sunil Khare whom she met last at the temple. “How to call him, text him or email him? I don’t have his contact info.” so thought Rhea. The best way to reach him is to go the Shirdi temple and wait for him. Somehow, due to the mental agony, fatigueand tiredness she dozed off a little in the early morning hours.</p><br>' +
'<p> It was a Saturday and that was her sleep-in day. Yet, she got up early and was at the Shirdi temple parking lot at 6:15AM waiting for Sunil to show up. Several cars pulled in, people gotout and entered the temple. Rhea was becoming impatient. At about 6:30, a white Toyota Corolla came in fully loaded with clothes, blanket, pillow, comforter, tiny table lamp,a laptop computer, a few books and other stuff. Slowly the door opened and out came Sunil walking towards the temple entrance. Rhea quickly went to the entrance, stopped him and shouted,</p><br>' +
'<p>“Sunil, I want to talk to you. It is urgent!” Sunilwas surprised to see her after a long time.</p></br><p>“Rhea, how are you? It has been a long time! Sure, we can talk. What is urgent now is to have Baba’s darshan. After the Arati, we can talk at length. Whatever is bothering you will vanish if you pray to Baba.”</p></br><p>Rhea felt somewhat snubbed at his response but she had no other recourse.  All these days, she didn’t believe in God or Baba but now, she was forced to pray for His help. As she begged Baba to resolve her problem, she was choked with emotions. After the final Arati at 8:00, Sunil and Rhea took the Prasadam in the kitchen. Rhea said:</p></br><p>“Shall we talk now?”</p></br><p>“Not here. Let us go outside. It looks like it is something personal.”</p></br>' +
'<p>Both were standing near Rhea’s car and Rhea poured her heart out to Sunil of everything that happened at work since the car accident. Sunil was a passive listener. He never said anything. Just then, it began to drizzle and Rhea asked Sunil to sit in the passenger’s side of the car. The car was filled fashion magazines, brochures and catalogs of women’s fine clothing and intimate apparel, perfumes, scarves, shopping bags from Victoria’s Secret and Ann Taylor, different colored shoes and watch bands,handbags, credit card statements etc. Sunil felt rather uneasy to sit in a woman’s car but he had no choice and he sat silently. Unable to bear his silence, Rhea blurted angrily:</p></br>' +
'<p>“So, Sunil, you have nothing to say after all that I have told you?”</p><br><p>“Rhea, I don’t know you that well. I was hesitating how to say this to you! You have placed your career as number one, personal fitness and beauty as number two, fashion/luxury as number three, professional contacts as number four, your personal life at the very bottom and there is no place for spirituality. Spirituality is the foundation of humanity and since you don’t have it, everything has crumbled. Now, you are asking me to comfort you!”</p><br><p>“What is wrong in aspiring for the highest position in any organization?”</p><br><p>“There is nothing wrong, but it has to be supported by a strong foundation of spirituality so that you can stay in that position for long. If your ego is driving you to aspire for that position, then the down fall is imminent.”</p><br><p>“Shut up Sunil! You talk like a saint! Are you telling me that your career goals were all based on spirituality?”</p><br>' +
'<p>“Will you allow me to talk without being rude?”</p><br><p>“I am so sorry! I hardly know you, yet I am taking the liberty to scream at you!”</p></br>' +
'<p>“Many years ago, I was working for Cisco in the Finance department. I repeatedly kept on telling the management, ‘the Company financesare not looking good.’ One day, there was a major layoff and I was one of them. Then, I joined a small start-up Fiasco (Financial Investment Advisors and Services Corp) and did very well. After many years, the CEO resigned and I took over the company and made it highly profitable. I sold the company to Merrill Lynch and made many millions. I could have bought a home, got married and settled down. Instead, I became greedy for money. I started my own Financial Services Company thinking that I could double or even triple my investment. This is when I failed. I lost all of it.….<br> To be continued</p>'

I borrowed money from my friends and started another company. Again, luck was not in my favor. I was totally broke. Some of my friends who were not married, allowed me to stay with them for a while but when they got married, I was booted out. I became a homeless person.”</p><br><p>“So, that made you spiritual?”</p><br><p>“No. I lost my father when I was ten and my mother brought me up. I was the only child. Since we were always struggling to make both ends meet, I understood the importance of money and craved for it. Just when I became homeless, I got the news that my mother was seriously ill. I had to borrow money from my friends to go to India to see her. She passed away within a few days of my arrival. I could not do any elaborate arrangements for her cremation. At my mother’s funeral, I met a person who was a devotee of Sri Sathya Sai Baba of Puttaparthi. He suggested that I go to Puttaparthi and have Baba’s darshan so that it could help me straighten my life. After I had His darshan, my whole life changed and I understood the real meaning of life.

My needs are very little.”</p><br>' +

Why were you crossing the road near the Penitencia Creek Bridge with bare foot when my car hit you?”</p><br><p>“Oh, that is a long story. I had given my car for service at Piercey Toyota in Milpitas. They promised that the car will be ready in the evening. When I went there, the Service person said that there were problems with the brakes and I have to leave the car with him for one more day. With nowhere to go, I walked from there to the Milpitas Shirdi temple for Dhup and Shej Arati. After the Shej Arati, I was wondering where to spend the night. Just then a devotee couple who had come for the Shej Arati, noticed my aimless wanderings in the temple premises. They asked me whether I needed any help. First I said I didn’t need any help, yet they insisted. I told them that I have no place to spend the night. The husband and wife were very nice. They told me that I could spend the night in their house. Their house is walkable distance from the temple, on the other side of Coyote Creek Bridge on Elkwood Drive. I told them that I will be leaving early to attend the Kakad Arati. They said to leave quietly without making noise. I had a quick shower, changed my clothes, held my shoes in my hand and walked quietly bare-footed to cross the bridge to reach the temple. You know what all happened after that.”</p><br>' +
'<p>“Now I know why you were carrying your old clothes in your back pack that morning. Sunil, are you not interested in finding a job?”</p><br/>' +
'<p>“You think I am not looking? Unfortunately, the Silicon Valley is flooded with software engineers, and finding a regular job is not that easy. I do many contract jobs that last for a few months. Without a steady job and a good bank balance, it is difficult to rent an apartment in this area.”</p><br/>' +
'<p>“Sunil, you have been very nice to me and you have hammered some sense into my head. What can I do for you? Would you like to stay in my house till your job situation gets better?”</p></br>' +
'<p>“Rhea, it is very kind of you to make me that offer. Somehow, I have been away from women all along. My only weakness was money and I am out of it now. Somehow, I have learnt to keep ‘woman and money’ away. I don’t want to go back on that path again.”</p></br>' +
'<p>“Sunil, I understand your point. Yet, I want to give you something in return for all the help you have given me. Tell me what I can do for you?”</p><br>' +
'<p>“Rhea, please listen to me carefully. When you go to orthodox temples in India for worship, they ask men to remove their shirt, the inner T-shirt (banyan), belt and bare their chests. Some temples even ask men to remove their pants, wallets and wear a Dhoti. Women are supposed to be fully covered, head-to-toe with a saree. In this country, when you go to a temple for worship, men are fully covered, whereas many women show off, thinking they are cultured, civilized, graceful and sophisticated. Today is a holiday and you came to me for advice. What is the need to have such a flashy dress for visiting a temple as if you are going for an Oscar award? Instead of spending hundreds of dollars for designer clothes, dress moderately and use the money saved to feed the hungry, poor and the homeless. When you dress temptingly and invitingly, you can expect problems. When you dress conservatively, people respect you and stay at arms-length even while speaking to you. For men, tie is a neck wear. For women, Duppatta is not a neck wear. Let your dress be one step behind the latest fashions.”</p></br>' +
'<p>“You are very selfish. You only make contacts with people who can help you in your career or do favors for you. Even when you spend time with them, you always keep thinking of ROI (Return on Investment), Preservation of Capital etc. Give up such expectations and let your friendship be genuine and come from your heart.”</p><br>' +
'<p>“Next, believe in God and pray to him whole heartedly to free you from the greed for worldly objects. When the greed goes down, compassion and love will blossom in your heart. Then your face will shine, radiate peace and people will be attracted to you naturally, not because of you are beautiful and attractive. Respect the elders and engage in some volunteering activity to make up for the time you have wasted so far in your life.”<br/>…… to be continued</p></br>',

                  content: '<p>“Sunil, it is all a wonderful piece of advice. Service to the poor is a good thing to do.  Let me think about it before I launch into volunteering.”</p></br>' +
'<p>“Rhea, the moment a noble thought occurs in your mind, you must put it into action right away. If you procrastinate, it will go away. The drizzle that we had a moment ago was a blessing from Baba that you are turning towards God. Look, it is only 9:30. The San Mateo Homeless Shelter is looking for people to sponsor lunch today. On Saturdays, there are about 20 women and a few men waiting for lunch. We can buy some Pizzas and soft drinks on the way and serve them lunch. Why don’t you go home, get dressed in some simple clothes and come back. I will be waiting for you here, at the temple. We will both go and feed the hungry today. What do you say?”</p><br>' +
'<p>“Sunil, it is a good idea. Let me go home, change and come back quickly.”</p><br/><p>“Good, good! Don’t change your mind!” Sunil got out of the car and waited for her in his 1982 Corolla.</p></br>' +
'<p>Rhea was serving the Pizza and Sunil was handing out soft drink cans. As they received the food from Rhea, many people said, “May God Bless you!” “May you and your family be happy!”At those moments, Rhea’s eyes moistened and something choked her throat. She had never seen so much of poverty in an affluent part of California. She really felt sad that she has squandered away all her money whereas these people didn’t have even some money to buy food. After lunch, Sunil introduced some of the women to Rhea. Rhea had a heart-to-heart conversation with them. Some of them were well educated professionals but fate had its way on them. She comforted and consoled them. All of them thanked her for taking the time to come and serve them. While they were talking, Sunil had quietly gone out and had bought several boxes of cookies. He prepared some hot tea in the kitchen and served them with cookies and tea. Everyone enjoyed the hospitality. The conversation continued till 4:00PM. Sunil and Rhea took leave of them and started walking towards to the parking lot. Sunil broke the silence.</p><br>' +
'<p>“Rhea, let this not be your first and last service to the poor. There are homeless shelters in Fremont, Milpitas, San Jose, Sunnyvale etc. Call them several weeks before and schedule your service for every weekend at different shelters. When you do service regularly, you will be surprised to find that you will become ‘rich’ and your life too will become ‘rich’. Once in a while, you will be able to spot me in one of the shelters. Do you get the picture?”</p><br>' +
'<p>Rhea was contemplating on Sunil’s words and could not fully fathom the meaning.</p><br/><p>Sunil asked Rhea, “You haven’t told me anything about your family!”</p><br/><p>“I am the only child and I am single. My mother passed away when I was thirteen. My father lives with me. He is a stick in the mud and he has his old ways.”</p><br/><p>“Don’t talk badly about your father. You have met me because of your father!”</p><br/><p>“You know him?”</p><br/><p>“Yes. We have known each other for ages! When you go home, please tell him that I have responded to his request. I hope you will continue to feed the homeless.” So saying, Sunil sped off in his car.</p><br>' +
'<p> When Rhea made a right turn from Stevenson Blvd into Liberty Street, the car was going very slowly. The kids who were playing stopped and watched her in wonder. She stopped in the middle of the road, lowered the window, talked to a few kids and even squeezed the cheek of a young boy with love! All the moms who were watching this from their drive-ways shouted in unison, “The Divine queen has arrived.”</p><br>' +
'<p>As Rhea entered the house, she saw her father coming out of the corner where he used to pray to Baba. Seeing her in a saree he asked, “Was there a party?”</p><br/><p>“No. I went to Costco to buy Pizza for the homeless.”</p><br/><p>“Wearing a saree?”</p><br/><p>“Dad, I met a homeless person, Sunil. I love him very much.”</p><br/><p>“Sai Raaam, Sai Raaam! I don’t like where this is going! Please don’t tell me that you want to marry him.”</p><br/><p>“Nah, Nah! Sunil said, ‘He has responded to your request.’ Do you know him?”</p><br/><p>“How does he look?”</p><br/><p>“Wears a white dress, carries a white bag containing his belongings and talks high philosophy.”</p><br>' +
'<p> Rhea’s father stood still for a minute thinking who that person could be?… Sunil… it doesn’t ring a bell….. Suddenly, his lips quivered and began to sob like a child. Rhea quickly hugged him and comforted him. After gaining composure, he spoke:</p><br><p>“Rhea, my dear child! I have been praying to Baba for many, many years asking Him to put some sense into your head. Seeing how you were behaving, I had given up all hope. Finally, He has come in the form of Sunil and answered my prayers. How loving He is! Baba used to say, ‘If wealth is used only for personal enjoyment, it is wasted.’ He works in very mysterious ways.</p><br><p>He says,‘I bring men to Me from long distances and many places. I seek them and bring them to Me. They do not come of their own accord… I bring them to Me!’</p><br>' +
'<p> I have been praying to Him since I was a teen-ager. Yet, He did not give me His vision. You never believed in God, yet, He gave you His Divine vision! How merciful is He! You were able to see Him, talk to Him, seek guidance from Him and worked together with Him and fed the poor. What else one can you ask for in this birth? Beti…. you are indeed blessed! Really blessed! (He chokes) Look at me, “I must have been a sinner in my past life!”, and he burst into tears.</p><br>' +
'<p>Tears welled up in Rhea’s eyes and she immediately fell at her father’s feet for the very first time and asked him to pardon all her mistakes and negligence towards her father. She said, “Dad, because of your prayers, I have been transformed. I have now realized that name, fame, position, wealth and money are not important in life. I promise you that I will take good care of you from now on, and you won’t feel like a neglected person in this house. Please forgive me, Dad.”<br/>' +
         '“Beti, get up and ask for forgiveness from Baba. Always keep chanting ‘Sai Ram Sai Ram’ because we don’t know when we will err and go in wrong ways. I am so happy today because, you are not only my daughter but you have become Baba’s daughter too!”  <br/><br/>' +
         '“By the way, how did you meet Sunil?”<br/>“Accidentally!”</p><br>' +
         '<p> On Monday, before going to work, Rhea stopped at the Shirdi temple to have Baba’s darshan.  She was looking for Sunil. She asked someone in the temple,</p><br>' +
         '<p>“Excuse me! I am looking for a homeless person by name Sunil who comes in the mornings.”</p><br>' +
         '<p>The person was somewhat perplexed at this question and out came the reply:</p><br>' +
         '<p>“We do not know of any homeless person by name Sunil. We only know of one Sunil who comes on weekend mornings but he has a home.”</p><br>' +
         '<p>Rhea remembered her father’s remark, ‘He works in very mysterious ways!’<br/><h5>Jai Sai Ram</h5>'

                      '<p>About six months ago, I had been to the Shirdi temple on a Thursday afternoon for Madhyan Arati. After having the Prasadam, I was sitting in the Main Hall looking at Baba.  A woman walked up to me and said:</p><br/>' +
                      '<p>“I was told that there is a person here who sends Baba’s messages every day. Do you know who he is?”</p><br/>' +

                      '<p>“OK”, I said disinterestedly.</p><br/>' +

                      '<p>I was trying to get away from her, as I did not believe in her story.</p><br/>' +
                      '<p>“You don’t want to hear the story?”</p><br/>' +
                      '<p>“No. I have to get back to work.”</p><br/>' +
                      '<p>I was thinking to myself, “I want to escape from her and she is not letting me.” Since I didn’t believe in the story, I was determined to prove her wrong.</p><br/>' +

                      '<p>“She became a very nice person.”</p><br/>' +
                      '<p>“She might have been a nice person even before. You are just trying to connect the two together!”</p><br/>' +
                      '<p>“No! I am telling you, she was very rude and nasty before and suddenly.. she became a very nice person.”</p><br/>' +
                      '<p>Every time I challenged her, the story became even longer with more details! So, I stopped questioning her. She narrated the whole story as quickly as possible because she could sense my impatience to break out of that conversation.</p><br/>' +
                      '<p>Just then, my old friend Ratnam showed up.</p><br/>' +

                      '<p>“No, I am asking, what are you doing these days? Working or retired?”</p><br/>' +
                      '<p>“Oh.., I am still working.”</p><br/>' +
                      '<p>“You haven’t changed a bit since I have seen you last.”</p><br/>' +

                      '<p>“I am in transition.. I am looking..”</p><br/>' +

                      '<p>Months later, I thought about it. “If it was real, won’t it be nice to share it with devotees?” Again, in due course of time, the thought faded away. A month ago, I was on vacation for a week in London. When I was praying to Baba in the morning, I got a message from Baba: “You have time to go on vacation, but you don’t have time to write my devotee’s story!”</p><br/>' +

Being a bachelor, I have to find a place to fill my tummy. I always hate this food searching expedition!  I want to call it quits for the day but I want to do a quick check on my Yahoo mail and Google my restaurant hunt. Suddenly, the phone rings! Who could that be? It was my class mate at UC Berkeley, Sailesh who is also a bachelor.<p/>' +
'<p>Sailesh screams, “Hey Kamesh, do you want to meet for dinner tonight?”</p>'
                  + 'I say, “It is a good idea. Where are you now?” (Now, I can stop hunting for the restaurants!)<br/>' +
'Sailesh: “Look, how about I meet you half way at the Shirdi temple in Milpitas? We can decide from there where to go for dinner. The address is 1221 California Circle.”<br/>'
+ 'I (reluctantly): “OK. What time?”<br/>'
+ 'Sailesh: “6:30PM in the parking lot”<br/>'
+ '<p>I: “OK. See you at 6:30 man!”</p>'
+ '<p><i><u>Sailesh is a character:</i></u> I don’t know what is with Sailesh! He always loves temples! He keeps chanting Vishnu Sahasranamam every day. When I ask him what it means he says, he does not know!  Even while we were in Berkeley, he used to wear Vibuthi on his forehead. People used to tell him, “You have a lot of powder left on your face!” I am not a fan of Baba or for that matter any God. They say, ‘Nothing moves without His will’. I am moving because of Him. So, I don’t have to go after Him. He is controlling all my actions whether good or bad. I was always flamboyant, explodingly masculine and wanted to enjoy life rather than be cooped up in temples praying all the time! Sailesh says whenever he wants to be free from stress he goes spiritual! Whenever I want to be free from stress, I go after spirits. He says whenever he has pain in the body, he goes after meditation. Whenever I have pain in my body, I go after medication. A couple of Advils will do the job! Now, I have to go and wait in the parking lot of that Shirdi temple for this guy!'
+ '<p><i><u>All circle in California Circle:</i></u>  So, I head down to California Circle and want to enter the temple but the entrance is blocked by several cars. Everybody is trying to find a place to park. What are these guys doing on a Thursday evening? I can understand Friday night ! They want to boogie!  ‘Move on guys! Nobody is going to get out from this temple now.’ Slowly, I inch my way while people are trying to straighten out their cars in their tiny parking spots. Finally, I find a parking place very far off from the temple. I start walking towards the temple. My worst fear is, ‘How am I going to find Sailesh in this mess of shining steel with wheels?’</p>'
+ '<p><i><u>Which entrance?:</i></u> If he is sensible, he would wait at the entrance. No sign at the entrance. There were some cement bags, some tools, some plastic buckets, a lot trash and some dirt. I go close to the glass door and it says, ‘Use the other entrance.’ That figures why this entrance is messy! I go to the other door. No signs of Sailesh either. What is going on with his spiritual rascal? Now, I have to remove my shoes, go in and try to locate this guy in the myriad of heads. There were a lot of people standing in a long serpentine line waiting for their turn to wave a lamp and about one hundred people were sitting and watching this fun. There was a marble statue of an old woman (may be a man with long hair?) and people were in awe looking at it! What do they see in this old woman? I was not interested in this old woman. I was on the hunt for this spiritual rascal, Sailesh.</p>'
+ '<p><i><u>The Arati Line:</i></u>  O there is Sailesh! in the Arati line, waving to me to come and join him! I wasn’t particularly interested in this ordeal. Just then I noticed a girl (whose back was turned towards me all the time) handing over the Arati plate and walking down the dais. She was beautiful! She looked exactly like Kathyayini whom I knew from Berkeley. I wanted to approach her and ask whether she was really Kathy (for short). If she is, it will be my dream, come true! Suddenly, somebody pats on my shoulder and points me to Sailesh and says he is calling you. He is waving vigorously. I turn to the right to see whether Kathy is still around. She has escaped from my sight! Damn! I rush to the front door to see whether she could be found anywhere. No luck. Now, I better not lose this rascal, Sailesh. I cut into the line, go behind Sailesh and wave the lamp at this figure! He has a beard! Weird! A man’s body and a woman’s hair tied up in a towel.. he must have come out of the shower! What is so great about him? Why the whole crowd of highly educated Silicon Valley professionals in suits, ties and dress pants and women waiting to see him? Just as this thought process was going on in my mind, the lady volunteer says, “Sir, please give the plate. Others are waiting!” I shove the plate in her hands and walk away. I say to myself, ‘I am not going come here again. This looks like a zoo. Too many people around here.’</p>'
+ '<p><i><u>Thursday is a busy day:</u></i> As soon as I get inside the car with Sailesh, I tell him, “Sailesh, because of you I missed meeting and talking to Kathy.” He says, “Kathy! I don’t think Kathy comes here or lives here. I don’t know where she is these days.” I was really sure that it was Kathy. How can I not recognize her? We spent many hours at Starbucks in Berkeley during our student days. <br/>'
+ 'I ask, “Sailesh, which is the busiest day at this temple?”<br/>  “Thursdays!”<br/>'
+ 'Immediately, it registered it in my mind. This is my chance to locate Kathy probably next Thursday.</p>'
+ '<p><i><u>Student Days at Berkeley:</u></i> It is interesting how I and Kathy met. It was in the dining hall. I was really mesmerized by her beauty. Small frame, slender figure, medium height, fair complexion, beautiful eyes, pleasant round face, beautiful lips, long thick black hair parted in the middle, small waist.. She looked like an angel!  No, she looked like a creeper (Pushpa Lata) and her face looked like a beautiful rose.  I immediately fell in love with her. If she was small, I would have wrapped her in a news paper, taken her to my room, kept her on my desk and admired her beauty all day. But she was almost as tall as me! I came to know later that she was biology major. I was a computer science guy. What kind of interesting chemistry is this?'
+ '<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After I went to back to my room, wherever I could see, I saw only her image. It is as if, a transparent stick-on image of her was pasted on to my glasses. I couldn’t think of anything else. I saw her in my dreams often. When Dr. Judith (my professor) was lecturing in the class, suddenly Judith disappeared and in her place Kathy was talking computer language. I couldn’t take my mind out of her. It looked like I was possessed by her. She had taken total control of my mind. There was no room for it to wiggle.</p>'
+ '<p><i><u>Meeting at Starbucks:</u></i> I enjoyed going to Starbucks and studying there. At least, there is some ‘color’ in life rather than just men walking in and around me in the dorm! One afternoon, she showed up at the Starbucks, bought a Cappuccino and was fumbling to find the cash. I was watching the fun. She did not have enough money to pay for the coffee.<br/> As a macho man, I walked in front of her and said, “Is there a problem?”<br/>  She was very shy and said, “I am out of cash”.<br/> I said, “I will pay for the coffee.”<br/> She refused and said, “Please lend me ten dollars. I will give it back to you next time.”<br/> This was my chance to win her hand!  I very happily handed over a fresh $10 note in her hands and sat down in my place. Being a university town, Starbucks is always crowded and nobody wanted to sit in front of this masculine figure! This poor girl had no other place to sit and having won my sympathy, at least as a courtesy, she had to talk to me. So, she sat in front of me. That is when I came to know that she is Kathyayini, biology major and that she is from Mysore.</p>'
+ '<p><i><u>Kathy writes a check:</u></i> My heart was palpitating! This angel is sitting in front of me and telling me all her background.  In the middle of the conversation, she pulled up her check book from the purse and said, “I don’t know when I am going to see you next. Shall I give you a check for ten dollars?” I hesitatingly said ‘yes’ because I wanted to meet her again at least on the pretext of getting back my ten dollars but she had decided otherwise! She wrote the check and her handwriting was like pearls! She asked, “Whom should I make it to?” I said, “Kamesh Bukkapalli!” She wrote my name beautifully..and her signature.. it was an exquisite piece of art! When she gave the check to me, I felt like touching her hands to see whether she was an angel or a real girl, but I held back my hand. This is how we met and the Starbucks became our regular meeting place during week day mornings and weekend afternoons. We never exchanged phone numbers or email addresses.</p>'
+ '<p><i><u>I love Kathy!:</i></u>  I was really in love with her but I didn’t have the courage to tell her. May be she was in love with me too but she was waiting to see who is going to break the ice first! The present day girls are very cunning!<br>'
+ 'After I went to my room, I opened the wallet and looked at the check. I didn’t feel like depositing the check. It had to be framed with a gold frame! The handwriting was beautiful. This angel had written my name on the ‘Pay To’. I thought it should be ‘To’. I thought it was love letter, not a check. I looked at her printed name. It said, ‘Kathyayini Somashekara Rao’. What a long name! And there was her address.. 2035 Bancroft way #3, Berkeley, CA 94704 and the phone number (510) 555-3424. Is she indirectly giving me a hint to call her? The apartment #3 also had a message for me. This was the third girl I had met in the campus during the first semester and somehow I did not connect well with the other two. They were all show-off types rousing  my manly desires. Kathy was dressed in a simple, traditional Indian style but very modestly and conservatively. Her countenance, the manner of speaking, attitude and behavior demanded respect even from scoundrels like me.</p>'
+ '<p><i><u>I love her name!:</i></u>  I started mentally repeating her name ‘Kathy, Kathy’. It didn’t invoke even an iota of love in me. I started pronouncing her full name very clearly, syllable by syllable, “Kathyayini Somashekara Rao, Kathyayini Somashekara Rao.” After repeating this several times, I felt that there was something divine about her name. I could not figure what it was. There was a nice musical ring to it! She must be a Brahmin girl! Only such people have these long names. She is not going to like my meat eating, drinking and girls chasing kind of habits. I better become a vegetarian, teetotaler, avoid girls and become respectable to be accepted by her. At once, I decided to give up all these vices! That is the power of love at first sight!</p>'
+ '<p><i><u>Kathy’s check:</i></u> I was still amazed at the check. She wrote my name beautifully on that tiny piece of bank paper. My handwriting can only be compared to a child’s scribbling. I wanted to practice her handwriting and write her name beautifully as my appreciation of her. I looked at her signature.. it was a long signature.. she didn’t sign as Kathy.. she actually signed her full name.. Kathyayini Somashekara Rao.  To impress her, I should practice writing her full name. Oh, this is a big task.. but I had some sort of satisfaction as if I am writing her name over her heart and it was worth all the trouble. My mind did not wander anywhere. I was always thinking about her while I was scribing her name one below the other as if they were carbon copies. The whole eight and half by eleven sheet of paper looked very beautiful as if somebody had carved it. The joy that I had was inexplicable. I was thinking vicariously, may be, she is also practicing my name ‘Kamesh Bukkapalli’. But she is a very smart girl. Even if she did it, she wouldn’t tell me. It is men who open up their hearts to women only to be ridiculed!</p>'
+ '<p><i><u>She is a flower:</i></u> Whenever I looked at her, there was no lust or bad thoughts lurking in me anywhere. I felt that she is a delicate flower, to be protected from harsh weather. Even the warmth from my hand will make this flower wither. Then, how can I even think of marrying her? I simply wanted to capture her image permanently in my retina. ‘A thing of beauty is a joy for ever’ – John Keats. I wanted to shed all my bad thoughts from my mind, shed all my bad habits and make some room for her in my heart. I wanted her to come and reside in my heart. Ah, I am becoming a poet spontaneously!<br/>'
+ '<u><i> Kathyayini   vinati   mee  karee  hridaya   mandiree  ya  basaa</i><br/>'
+ 'Samastha  jaga  he   Kathyayini swaroopachee   thaso   maanasaa</i><br>'
+ '(O Amba, Kathyayini, I am making a humble request to you. Please come and dwell in the temple of my heart. The entire world is nothing but the form of my Amba Kathyayini and let his fact be firmly impressed in my mind.) </u></p>'
+ '<p><i><u>Second Visit:</u></i> Next Thursday, I promptly show up at the temple at 6:00PM not for Baba’s darshan but for Kathy’s darshan.<br/>'
+ '<i><u>Aso  naso  bhaava  aalo  tujziyaa   thaaya</i><br/>'
+ 'Whether or not I have real devotion, yet I have come to your place (for Kathy’s darshan!)</u><p/>'
+ '<p><u><i>Which Line?:</i></u> I am standing in the line and someone asks me, “There is a Darshan line and Arati line. Which line are you in?”<br/> I say quickly, “Darshan line” because I want to have Kathy’s Darshan! They ask me to move forward and I see people kneeling over as in a church. When my turn comes, I kneel in front of Baba’s feet and I beg him, “Baba, please give me Darshan of ..”<br/> before I could finish the sentence, one volunteer started closing the kneeling area saying, “Arati is going to start now. Please move.”<br/> So, immediately I run back to the Arati line thinking I could complete my prayer asking for Kathy’s darshan. <br/>'
+ '&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wait for my turn in the Arati line. I started waving the Arati plate saying, “Baba, I came in the Darshan line but I could not complete my prayer. Now I am in the Arati line. I want you to give me Darshan of my...K”. Before I could complete, the volunteer took the plate away from me and asked me to go and sit down. What is going on here? There is regimental prayer here?</p>'
+ '<p><u><i>My prayer:</i></u>  I slowly walk and sit down looking at Baba’s face. Tears roll down my cheeks because I could not complete my prayer. ‘Baba is not going to help me find Kathy?’ was my thought. I started looking at all the girls. None had any resemblance to my Kathy. May be she has not come today? Again I look at Baba and pray sincerely, “Baba, please, please give me at least one chance to meet my Kathy. That is all that I ask. I just want to see her once. Nothing else.” After taking the Ararti, I slowly walked towards the kitchen in disappointment.</p>'
+ '<p><u><i>Sailesh spots me:</i></u> In the kitchen, Sailesh looks at me and shouts, “Sairam Kamesh!” I wonder, “Is he addressing me as Mr. Kamesh?” I asked him what it meant. He says you should keep on saying “Sairam, Sairam”. This is called Namasmarana. It started to ring a bell! I was all along repeating in my mind endlessly, “Kathyayini Somasekhara Rao, Kathyayini Somasekhara Rao” and that was actually Namasmarana!  Now I have got to say, “Sairam, Sairam” to get Baba’s grace to see my Kathy. Actually, Sairam is easy to repeat than the way too long name of Kathy. Since I badly want to see Kathy, I am ready to do anything.</p>'
+ '<p><u><i>Third visit:</i></u> Now that I got used to the routine in the temple, my prayers were all short and completed in the allotted time. My anger began to subside and I developed a firm faith that Baba will find my Kathy one day. The only thing I was not sure was - when? Baba seems to have His own time table. However, I am not going to budge from visiting this temple until he gives me Kathy’s darshan. While I was walking down the hallway to the main entrance, there was a table and several items were displayed there. </p>'
+ '<p><u><i>What is this Japam?:</i></u> There was a book with ‘Likhitha Japam’ written on it.<br/> I opened the book and it was totally blank. There was nothing printed on it. It looked like a stenographer’s note book.<br/> I asked one of the volunteers, “Why is the book blank?”<br/> She said, “It is for you to write.” “Write what?” I retorted.<br/> “Write Om Sri Sairam” “This is for Likhitha Japam” and she showed one of the books where a devotee had filled the book with ‘Om Sri Sairam’ from top to bottom. It looked beautiful and it looked exactly like Kathy’s handwriting.<br/>  It occurred to me that when I was repeatedly writing ‘Kathyayini Somashekara Rao,  Kathyayini Somashekara Rao’ one below the other on a piece of paper, I was actually doing Likhitha Japam of Kathyayini!<br/> I asked the girl to give me one Likitha Japan book which had 1008 spaces to write ‘Om Sri Sairam’. Whenever I had some time during lunch break, or waiting in line at the DMV or at the grocery store, I wrote with dedication ‘Om Sri Sairam’ and filled the book thinking that Baba would certainly find my Kathy. Also, instead of saying, ‘Good morning or Good evening’, my tongue spontaneously said, ‘Sai Ram.’ I had to curb that some time at work because people didn’t understand what it meant, but it meant a lot to me. It was the magic mantra for having Kathy’s darshan.</p>'
+ '<p><u><i>Shirdi temple becomes my routine:</i></u> Slowly, I became a regular Thursday evening devotee at the Shirdi temple and started participating in Bhajans etc. Some of the devotees told me that I should visit Shirdi where Baba lives even today, and it is a divine experience. Within a month, I was asked to visit my company’s branch in Mumbai and spend two weeks there to get a ‘feel’ for what was going on there. This was something I never expected. </p>'
+ '<p><u><i>Visit to Shirdi:</i></u> I felt that I should visit Shirdi before attending to my company’s work in Mumbai. So, I left a few days earlier than my planned two weeks and had a trip to Shirdi. The number of devotees and the crowd at Shirdi was overwhelming. I could barely get a one minute of Darshan before the security personnel pushed me out. However, the experience was ever lasting. People came walking bare foot from various states to get a one minute glimpse of Baba going through many hardships. It was really amazing to see their devotion compared to my partly devotion towards Baba. I was wondering how I landed so quickly in Shirdi. It was His call!</p>'
+ '<p><u><i>Travel becomes a routine:</i></u> As days passed by, my responsibilities at work increased and I started travelling nationally and internationally. I always arranged my trips such that I would be in town on Thursdays to visit the Shirdi temple in Milpitas. On one Monday, February 13th, due to my international travel, I could not do that. My flight was in the afternoon and I decided to attend the Kakad Arati in the morning to make up for the Thursday Arati which I would be missing.  The crowd in the morning was much less compared to Thursdays and I was first in the line for Kakad Arati. As I started waving the Arati plate something interesting happened.</p>'
+ '<p><u><i>Finally, Kathy’s darshan:</i></u> As I was waving the Arati to Baba, slowly Baba turned into a woman and looked exactly like my Kathy! I was trying to shout, ‘Kathy! Kathy!’ but my tongue was stuck and only some air came out from my mouth!<br/><u></i> Kamesh  kahe  ab  kyaa  bolo, Thak  gayi mere rasnaa</i> (Kamesh says, “What shall I say now? My tongue has failed due to emotion” )</u></p>'
+ '<p><u><i>Kathy starts talking:</i></u>  Slowly, I became normal and asked Kathy,<br/> “Can I talk to you privately?”<br/>'
+ 'Kathy replied, “Nobody can hear our conversation now!”<br/>'
+ 'I asked, “Why did it take so long?”<br/>'
+ 'Kathy said, “Till your prayers became intense, I could not come to you!”<br/>'
+ 'I asked, “Are you the same Kathy whom I met in Berkeley in my student days?”<br/>'
+ 'Kathy said, “You fool! That Kathy was just a hook to get you here. I am Sai Baba. Don’t you know that I can take any form at any time to please my devotees?”<br/>'
+ 'I said, “I am a scoundrel. I didn’t believe in God all these days. How I can be your devotee?”<br/>'
+ 'Kathy replied, “In your past life, you were a very devout person. Due to bad company, you picked up bad habits. That is why I made you meet Kathy who got rid of your bad habits in a trice.”<br/>'
+ 'I asked again, “Then, my Kathy is still there in Berkeley?”<br/>'
+ 'Kathy replied, “You are asking foolish questions again and again! You were repeating the name ‘Kathyayini Somasekhara Rao’ Do you know what it meant? <br/>'
+ 'Rao means ‘one who worhsips’. Somasekhara is another name of ‘Shiva’. Kathyayini also means ‘Parvathy’.  So, your Namasmarana meant ‘Parvathy who worships Shiva’. When you started writing Kathy’s full name repeatedly it meant the same thing: ‘Parvathy who worships Shiva’.  So, you were always thinking of me and actually praying and appealing to Kathyayini who is Shiva’s wife. Wherever your eyes fell, you saw only my form. You had no other thought other than Me. When you started repeating the name ‘Om Sri Sairam’, you were actually praying to my consort Lord Shiva. He was pleased with your prayers and asked me to appear before you as Kathyayini. Please fill your eyes full with My beautiful form and take My blessings.  Please do it quickly because I have to attend to the needs of other devotees!”<p/>'
+ '<p><u><i>Why three girls? :</i></u> I asked, “Amba, why I had to meet the two girls before I met you?” Kathy replied, “The first two girls you met represent Tamas and Rajas. They bind you to the world. You quickly realized it and walked away from them. Kathy represents Sattva guna and it takes you closer to God. However, you have to transcend even the Sattva guna to reach Me. I took Kathy away from you for that reason.”</p>'
+ '<p><u><i>I will share this story:</i></u> I said, “Amba, Parvathy, I am really blessed. Thank you for straightening my life and pulling me out of the worldly desires. I was infatuated with Kathy. You broke my worldly shackles with your own hands.<br>'
+ '<u><i>Bhavapaasaa  haathee  aapulyaa  todee</i> (Please break my worldly shackles with your own hands.- Sant Tukaram )</u> You work in mysterious ways.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In America, they celebrate Valentine’s Day on February 14th. I will share this story with my friends. Since I came to know you through Kathy, I will name the story ‘Baba, Please be my Valentine!’<br/> Hopefully, the present day teen agers and college students who are caught up in the worldly love will be able to direct that love towards You and attain liberation.’</p>'
+ '<p><i><span style="color:orange;">I bring men to Me from long distances and many places. I seek them and bring them to Me. They do not come of their own accord. I bring them to Me! - Baba</span></i><p/>'
+ '<p>Baba,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My humble Pranams at your lotus feet. In our scriptures, they always depict You as Purusha (man) and all the living beings (jeevis) as women longing to merge with You. I had to depict You as a woman so that the story will be interesting to the readers.  Baba, thank for your for inspiring me to write this story as well as guiding me in developing the story. Please make my mind dwell on Your Lotus feet all the time and let me not have any other thought other than You!<br/>'
