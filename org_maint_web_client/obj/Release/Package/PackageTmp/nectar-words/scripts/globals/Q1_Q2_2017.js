Until the man realizes the God within, he will be assiduously seeking Him elsewhere.  ',

But, sit near a stream and eat it. Though the total weight has not decreased, you don’t feel the burden. Similarly, apply this idea to God. Do not carry Him on your shoulder, take ‘Him’ in. Let Him blossom within you.',

Even if there is one such thing, when it is lost, you become sad! This is the very nature of the world. So, try to correct the mind which experiences joy and sorrow. Control your mind and train it to accept and see the real nature of the world. This is the real purpose of education.',
