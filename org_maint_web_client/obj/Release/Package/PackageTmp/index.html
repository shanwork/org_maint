            Hi, <p>
                <i>It was about time, I presented something to the outside world, so I picked up a basic hosting package and started publishing....</i><p>
            <p>
               <h3>Published Work as on <span id="dateShow"></span> </h3>
                <a href="#budgetSite"><li>About the Budgeting Wesbite</a></li>
                <a name="budgetSite"><h5>Budgeting Wesbite</h5></a>
                As of   I have developed the  budgeting website. Some background:<br />
                A humanitarian effort like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naam_Foundation" target="_blank">NAAM movement for Farmer Suicides in Maharashtra (India)</a> has different ways by which we can help.
                Sometimes organized accounting may take a backseat to the more urgent needs and emotions to resolve things, help etc. Thus entered an idea into my head to use a subject matter to apply whatever I am in the process of learning.
                <br />

                At this point, this is a simple accounting web site with the aim of tracking finances, how much the inflow is, what is the deficit, how the funds have  been used, etc.<br />
                While, as said, it was initiated with NAAM as an inspiration, it can be applied to any calamity or disaster situation, or any regular situation where a budget is used to maintain
                a list of items, say a transport service which maintains a bunch of trucks.
