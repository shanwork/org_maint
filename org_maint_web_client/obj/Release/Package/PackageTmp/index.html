                           <br/>... Kind of, No... because these are words which  <em>Hans Gruber</em> (the late Alan Rickman) speaks before he does away with <em>Joseph Takagi</em> of Nakatomi corp in the movie <em>Die Hard</em>, one of my favorites and which I have just begun to tire of seeing repeatedly.

                            In truth, it applies to today's world in both a good and not so good sense:
                            <br/>The world around is changing. We have access to more and more of stuff, more stuff to see, eat, buy and to do. We cant complain of boredom; we have no right to weep.
                            <br/>That said, it is because the world is changing so rapidly especially in the field I am in - IT - there is also the need to stay with or ahead of the game. 
                            Dad used to go to work at 9:00 AM do a lot of the same thing over and over again

                            at his office, then come home by 6:00 pm. Do nothing on the weekend.
                            <br/>It's changed now. A year and a half  ago I was doing sql server maintenance, writing web services in microsoft technologies and writing layered web apps. Today I am angular front end guy doing single page stuff using somethinng they call MV*., Tomorrow I could be writing mark up and styling that does everything in the html layer... Or learn python for machine learning to join (Cyberdyne systems)...<br/> I lag behind and a horde of yuppies and puppies are there to take my

                            place. Scary? Can be, sometimes. Fun? RIGHT!!!

                          <em>Also, Teamwork:</em><br/>I remember the last working day of a recent year. The day for roll out to <em>Production</em>. Was supposed to be a formality.
                         <br />The Team was all in by 10:00 AM and we were supposed to wish each other and leave by 12:00 PM. We'd just ended a

                            roller coaster of a developer cycle ride seeing the target move so many times as we raised our guns, yet managed to stick to our commited deadline. We were already patting ourselves on the back.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We finally left at 6:00 PM that day, the last in the building to leave(The security guy passed our room 4 -5 times, trying not to look too curious..).
                           <br/> What happened in between is a test of how one should be street smart and how the team worked and stood together.
                           <br/>
                            A new batch of data just came in for our happy path testing. <br/><em>Catch</em>: this data had lot of missing values, lot of missing fields (as well!). Stuff breaking. breaking. breaking.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing <em>'{{....}}'</em> instead of text on the browser all over.
                            <br/> Our fault at

                            (lack of) defensive programming? Probably. Then what about the previous batches which never had this?
                          </p>
                          <p>
                         Our management was panicking, arguments were flying back and forth.&nbsp;&nbsp;Non seasonal jargon was threatening to enter the roon.&nbsp;&nbsp; Coffee cups were forning a pile, peoples breath were of burnt tobacco...<br/>&nbsp; At the same time, some of us were putting our heads down, innovating, cutting

                            corners, shoring up our code. I was in the enviable position of the front end where the fixes would show and impress.<br/> I was also part of that last group. With the higher ups about to make a decision, I stopped all, and projected my local version of the

                            app UI (with the new data) unit tested, unit regression tested. Jaws dropped. Realization of the fact that this was being fixed sunk in across the war room. Then the enthusiasm, the fire and the energy returned. Tested again

                        Hi, <p>
                            <i>It was about time, I presented something to the outside world, so I picked up a basic hosting package and started publishing....</i>
                        <p>

                            <h3>Published Work as on <span id="dateShow">{{todayShort}} </span> </h3>
                            <a href="#budgetSite"><li>About the Budgeting Wesbite</a></li>
                            <a name="budgetSite"><h5>Budgeting Wesbite</h5></a>
                            As of   I have developed the  budgeting website. Some background:<br />
                            A humanitarian effort like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naam_Foundation" target="_blank">NAAM movement for Farmer Suicides in Maharashtra (India)</a> has different ways by which we can help.
                            Sometimes organized accounting may take a backseat to the more urgent needs and emotions to resolve things, help etc. Thus entered an idea into my head to use a subject matter to apply whatever I am in the process of learning.
                            <br />

                            At this point, this is a simple accounting web site with the aim of tracking finances, how much the inflow is, what is the deficit, how the funds have  been used, etc.<br />
                            While, as said, it was initiated with NAAM as an inspiration, it can be applied to any calamity or disaster situation, or any regular situation where a budget is used to maintain
                            a list of items, say a transport service which maintains a bunch of trucks.
