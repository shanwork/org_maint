    <li class="li-header"> What this application is about</li>
    <li>Taking my liking to code in Javascript, I am attempting write a JavaScript library</li>
    <li>This application applies the library to a fictitous scenario of sales of a pizza restaurant</li>
    <li>Application of concepts brought out in the library I am in the process of writing
          <ul>
            <li class="li-header">My own version of deep copy and value modification to clone an object and modify its values on the fly</li>
            <li>Taking a base JSON object (of a pizza order), for x orders a day for y days, the app generates x * y (-1) clones of the original object</li>
            <li>The API I have written is also passed a key modifying JSON object with random values, modifying the values of each clone as they are generated </li>
            <li>Additionally, plots of revenue, quantity, profit and respective avarages are generated.</li>
            <li>The statistics view is trying to display agrregate data and statistics related to this data</li>
            <li class="li-header">Statistics (WIP)</li>
            <li>I am calculating averages and deviation for different sets of quantities</li>
            <li>I am in the process of working on different statistical elements like Variance, deviations, etc.</li>
            <li> Also will seek out other interesting Math formulae and try and put them in  </li>
             
            
            
        </ul>
