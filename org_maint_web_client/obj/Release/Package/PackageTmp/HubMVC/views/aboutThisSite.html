    <i>Disclaimer:<br/> Please note this blog is a living docunent and will be iteratively changing<br/>
       Also, I haven't been too fancy, too orderly or consistent on my images.<br /> I would also have liked this to be less of a static site, adding animation and user events, but constraints on time etc have 
    left me with little bandwidth to do so. I do HOPE to get this in order. <br/>.. so please bear with me</i>
   
   <p> Hi, <p>
       I have been dabbling around in web application development using the layered (UI middle tiers backend data) and MVC patterns<p>
        Each has its advantages and drawbacks. However, the trend today has been more towards the MVC pattern, whose basic is as shown:  <p />

    <a name="mvc limit"><h3>Limitations of MVC </h3></a>
    Taking the basic ring of nodes above, if you try to design a system with separate flows, <b>but with</b> inter-dependencies, the situation can get complex with 
    increasing amount of dependencies and can even get messy. Shown below:<br/>

    <a name="hMVC concept"><h3>Concept of Hub MVC </h3></a>
    <p>Enter Hub MVC. <br />This is not a completely new concept. It is just an attempt to bring some order and anchor point to that intricate web shown above, and 
    selectively hide it </p>Shown below. One thought is to take away the complexity of interrelationships away from the teams does the separate flows and offer an API - let's call it Hub API

    <a name="hMVC variant1"><h3>Inner details - one example  </h3></a>

    <p>
        Thoughts of what would be behind the scenes, how input and output are handled...<br/> 
      This is one way of how the models 'pour' into the Hub, and controllers 'extract' from it through an API.    Shown below. <p/>

    <p>Now let's add external sources and dependencies like angular libraries, etc </p>

    This is not a classic or extensive application of this pattern, but it <i>does</i> use the concept of a central hub where data and signals flow in and out of<br/>

    Showing how HMVC is applied here. To repeat, it is not a classic example, just uses the concept<br/>
