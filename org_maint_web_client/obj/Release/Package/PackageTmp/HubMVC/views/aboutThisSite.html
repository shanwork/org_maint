        <h5><a name="basic mvc"> Basic MVC </a></h5>
         I have been dabbling around in web application development using  the layered (UI middle tiers backend data) and MVC patterns.Each has its advantages and drawbacks. However, the trend today has been more towards the MVC pattern, whose basic is as shown:<br/>

            Taking the basic ring of nodes above, if you try to design a system with separate flows, <b>but with</b> inter-dependencies, the situation can get complex with
            increasing amount of dependencies and can even get messy. Shown below:(click to enlarge)<br />

                <strong>Enter Hub MVC.</strong> <br />This is not a completely new concept. It is just an attempt to bring some order and anchor point to that intricate web shown above, and
                selectively hide it.<br/>Shown below. (click to enlarge)<br/>

            Thoughts of what would be behind the scenes, how input and output are handled...<br />
            This is one way of how the models 'pour' into the Hub, and controllers 'extract' from it through an API.    Shown below.(click to enlarge)

        This is not a classic or extensive application of this pattern, but it <i>does</i> use the concept of a central hub where data and signals flow in and out of<br />

            <h5><a name="hHMVC budget maintenance"> Budgetting website </a> </h5>
        <em><strong>The theme that set me on thinking about this pattern.</strong></em> <br />
        My idea of application of the <u>classic Hub, Mother Ship or Single Dependency Injection</u> pattern.<br />
        The germ of the idea came up when developing the <a href="../../myApp/budget/home.html" target="_blank"> original budgetting application </a>
        I conceptualized the budgetting site into three main sets of elements
        <ul >
            <li >Requirements (or needs)</li>
            <li>  Contributions</li>
            <li>  Budget Status</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Whenever a requirement was added, the required amount in the budget went up, as also a new update to budget history lists, so we had a dependency injected of the budget status class in the requirements class</li>
            <li>Likewise for contributions added, it was DI for budget status.</li>
            <li>While with the budget there would potentially be dependency injection from requirements and contributions</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <em><u>Now,</u></em> if I were to add or change, say, add one more MVC (let's say I want to be able to factor in non cash contributions), or
            automate something, like the allocation when a new contributor or requirement is added, it could potentially mean having to change multiple files and logic.
            <br /><em>(A further example:<br />I have worked in the manufacturing industry. A product has many many components and other dependencies which keep changing. Imagine trying to maintain this using  a network of MVC flows...)</em>
        </p>
        Shown below, how I would go about using  the Hub concept for the budgeting website. To repeat, HUB is the one-stop shop for my calculation and processing <br/>
        The website is under construction. <strong>Lacks styling and stuff like sorting and filtering, but you can find it <a href="../../myApp/naam/home.html">Here</a></strong>
