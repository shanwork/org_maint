        <strong>Ganesh Jayanti</strong> (literally "Ganesha's birthday"), also known as <strong>Magha shukla chaturthi, Tilkund chaturthi, and Varad chaturthi</strong>, is a Hindu festival. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;This occasion celebrates the birth day of Ganesha, the lord of wisdom.[1] It is a popular festival particularly in the Indian state of Maharashtra and it is also celebrated in goa held during the shukla paksha chaturthi day (fourth day of the bright fortnight or the waxing moon) in the month of Maagha as per almanac, which corresponds to the Gregorian calendar month of January/February.</p>
        <p> The distinction between the Ganesh Jayanti and the more popular, almost pan-Indian Ganesh Chaturthi festival is that the latter festival is observed in the month of August/September (Bhadrapada Hindu month). According to one tradition, Ganesh Chaturthi is also considered as the birthday of Ganesha.[2][3] </p>This festival of Ganesha is also called as the Tilo Chauth or Sakat Chauthis in Uttar Pradesh, where Ganesha is invoked on behalf of the son of a family.[3] It is also called as Tilkund chaturthi in Maharashtra.
