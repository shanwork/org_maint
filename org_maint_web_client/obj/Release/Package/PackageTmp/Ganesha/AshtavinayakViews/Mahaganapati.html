    <h3>Shree Mahaganapati if Ranjangaon</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;Ranjangaon is 50 Kms. from Pune and buses are available to reach this place.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The temple dates back to 9th century or 10th century. Its sanctum sanctorum was built by the senior Madhavrao Peshwa in 1768. The temple is east-facing. There is a basement below the temple where a small idol of Ganesha is installed, which has 20 hands and 10 trunks. It is said that this is the original idol of the temple.</p>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;The legend of the temple goes thus: (Ganesha Purana)<br />
        Grudsamad was a devotee of Lord Ganesha. A son was born to him. When he grew up, he wanted to conquer all the three Lokas. He was told by his father to pray to Lord Gajanan for the fulfilment of his wish. After intensive Tapas Lord Gajanan was pleased, and gave him the boon that nobody except Lord Shankara could destroy him. He also gave three Puras of steel, silver and gold to the prince. He became an Asura in his later years known as Tripurasur.
        <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Tripurasur conquered all the three Lokas. He and his two army chiefs started humiliating all gods and human beings. Finally the gods went to Lord Siva and prayed to him for destruction of Tripurasur. Lord Siva worshipped Lord Ganesha and finally killed the devil. The place, where Lord Siva worshipped Lord Ganesha came to be known as Ranjangaon.
