    <h3>Shri Siddhivinayak of Siddhatek</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Though Siddhatek is prescribed to the second temple to be visited in the Ashtavinayak circuit after the foremost Morgaon, pilgrims often visit it third after Morgaon and Theur, as it is a more convenient route.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ganesha icon here is with his trunk turned to the right. Usually, the trunk of Ganesha is depicted turned to his left. It is believed that the right-trunked Ganesha is very powerful, but difficult to please.  This is the only Ashtavinayaka shrine where the deity has his trunk to the right.Traditionally, an icon whose trunk is to the right is named "Siddhi-Vinayaka", the giver of siddhi ("accomplishment, success", "supernatural powers").  The temple is thus considered as a jagrut kshetra where the deity is said to highly powerful.</p>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;Story: The Mudgala Purana narrates<br />
        At the beginning of Creation, the creator-god Brahma emerges from a lotus, that rises the god Vishnu's navel as Vishnu sleeps in his yoganidra. While Brahma starts creating the universe, two demons Madhu and Kaitabha rise from the dirt in Vishnu's ear. The demons disturb Brahma's process of creation, thereby compelling Vishnu to awake. Vishnu battles the battle, but cannot defeat them. He asks the god Shiva the reason for this. Shiva informs Vishnu that he cannot succeed as he had forgotten to invoke Ganesha – the god of beginning and obstacle removal – before the fight. Therefore Vishnu performs penance at Siddhatek, invoking Ganesha with his mantra – "Om Sri Ganeshaya Namah". Pleased, Ganesha bestows his blessings and various siddhis ("powers") on Vishnu, returns to his fight and slays the demons. The place where Vishnu acquired siddhis was thereafter known as Siddhatek.
