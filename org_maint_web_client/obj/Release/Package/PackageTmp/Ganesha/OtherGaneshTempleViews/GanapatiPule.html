    <h3>Ganapati Temple of Ganapati Pule</h3>
    <p>Ganpatipule (Gaṇpatīpuḷē) is a small town located in the Ratnagiri district on the Konkan coast of Maharashtra,[2][3] in the sub-continent of India. The town of Chiplun is located to its north.</p>
    <p>According to local folklore, the Hindu god Ganapati, taking umbrage at a remark made by a native lady, moved to Pulé पुळे (a few km before the town) from his original abode of Gulé. Thus the region was named Ganpati-pulé.

The 400-year-old Ganpati idol at Ganpatipule is said to have sprung up from the soil.[4] This deity faces the west, so as to guard the western gates, unlike deities in other Indian temples who face the east. The temple is at the base of a hill, and pilgrims walk around (pradakshina) the hill as a mark of respect.</p>
