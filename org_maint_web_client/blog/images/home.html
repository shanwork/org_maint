                        Hello friends. Welcome to my blog</p>
                    <p>
                        At this point, I'll just be publishing stuff which I have posted on FB. Poems, only. Maybe adorn with appropriate styling and photos. Maybe add passages of text.. Maybe, a lot of things..
                        <br/>&nbsp;Been in the software profession, I am focusing  my sites on web development, the 'Front End' (as they say). I am re-discovering the joys that be in showing some cool <em>(at least I think so)</em> styled web content.
                    </p>
                    <p><em>(For software developers)</em><br/>This blog is, currently, hard coded. I am writing text directly in the markup. Pretty soon <em>(define 'pretty'? ..anything from one month to one year)</em>, I'll put the content behind a hosted web service and a data base. And yes, I am using  the <em>Bootstrap carousel and div classes</em></p>
                    <p>The pages that unfold are some of my writings, opinions, maybe just some photos patches together.. anything</p>

                    <p>I used to be a huuge fan of Gavaskar, with Kapil running a close second. I remember Mom shouting at me to 'study' and me arguing back for witnessing history. The 29th Ton against the Windies. The 30th. The 10,000th run. Seeing the beautful outswing, inswing and late swing bowling leaving many a batsman clueless.  </p>

                        There's too much to write about this super legend in this blog. But a few points:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Oft repeated statement <em style="font-size:larger">"If Cricket is a religion, He is the God"</em> </li>
                            <li>Cricket following and viewership dropped <em>significantly after he retired</em></li>
                            <li>Gutsy Guy. In his first series, he was bleeding in the nose from a ball that hit him, but played on, raw lad of 16</li>
                        </ul>
                        </div></p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="longArticle" style="margin-left:100px;margin-right:50px;width:600px">Here are the lyrics I've composed in tribute to the maestro, 'modified'  ABBAs 'Thank you for the music'  <br/><br/>
                        He seems nothing special, just the boy next door<br/>
                        If you hear him speak, you've never head him before<br />
                        But He's got this talent, this God Gifted thing<br />
                        Cause everyone watches when his bat starts to sing<br />
                        he's so grateful and proud<br />
                        All he wants is to hit out of ground<br /><br />

                        <span> So We say</span><br />
                        Thank you dear Sachin, many a great inning<br />
                        Thanks for all the joy youve given<br />
                        Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty<br />
                        What would life be?<br />
                        Without a four or six what are we?<br />
                        So I say thank you for your batting<br />
                        For giving it to we<br /><br />

                        Mother says he was hooking before he could walk<br />
                        She says he donned his pads long before he could talk<br />
                        And I've often wondered, where did it all start?<br />
                        Achrekar's class where cricket is art<br />
                        Like a craftsman can?<br />
                        Well, whoever it was, I'm a fan<br /><br />

                        (Thanks Simon and Garfunkel for giving us this (original) immortal song which I have taken the boldness to adapt to today's malady<br /><br/>
                        Hello smartphone, my new fiend,
<br/>
I've come to lean on you again,
<br/>
Because my weak mind’s started sleeping,
<br/>
And my fingers start their twitching,
<br/>
And the vision that was texted in my brain
<br/>
Still remains
<br/>
Within the keys of silence.
<br/><br/>
In bent posture I walk alone
<br/>
Cocooned off in FB zone,
<br/>
Got my sixth sense super working
<br/>
Walking blind hardly looking
<br/>
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a new invite 
<br/>
That flashed in Might
<br/>
And touched the keys of silence.
                        <br /><br />
And in whatsapp scroll I saw
<br/>
Posts, photos, likes galore.
<br/>
People texting without feeling,
<br/>
People liking without thinking,
<br/>
People checking in that none should really care
<br/>
And no one dared
<br/>
Disturb the keys of silence.
                        <br /><br />
"Fools" said I,"You do not know
<br/>
Texting like a cancer grows.
<br/>
Look up and it may save you,
<br/>
Accident that may break you
<br/>
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
<br/>
And echoed
<br/>
In the texts of silence
                        <br /><br />
And the people bowed and played 
<br/>
With the smartphone God they made.
<br/>
And this God send out a warning,
<br/>
“Buddy I need some charging”.
<br/>
And the signs said, 'The words of the prophets are written on whatsapp groups
<br/>
And facebook coops”.
<br/>
And whisper'd in the keys of silence.<br/>
