                                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presented is a sort of pictorial insite of Adi Shakti and Her various forms. Parvati/Durga is the consort of Lord Shiva. Laxmi is the consort of Lord Vishnu, and 
                                        Saraswati of Lord Brahma. <br/>
                                        As of October 2020, this sequence of views is an emphasis on the Hindu festival of <em><strong>Sharad Navratri</strong></em>
                                        <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legend has it that this is the celebration of the victory of the Goddess Durga after a prolonged and rather exhausting fight over 
                                        the super demon Mahishasur, and death of the latter. The festival is 9 days long and the 10th day is known as VijayaDashmi or Dassera. (Dassera is the day when Lord Ram
                                        manages to kill Ravana)
                                    </p>
                                    <p>The Nine Days of Navratri are celebrated with lot of fun and gaety. I am attempting to cover the aspect of the forms/avatars of the Goddess, which are shown as a sort of advance 
                                        summary below:<br/>
                                        In the subsequent pages, I attempt to capture, through my drawings, the different forms the Goddess in 'context of' Navratri
                                        <br/>Firstly, the nine days of Navratri are divided by which deity (form of Shakti) to celebrate in order.
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Goddess Durga (Days 1-3)</li>
                                            <li>Goddess laxmi(Days 4-6)</li>
                                            <li>Goddess Saraswati(Days 7-9)</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <br/>Then, each of the 9 days of Navratri is representational of an Avatar of the Goddess
