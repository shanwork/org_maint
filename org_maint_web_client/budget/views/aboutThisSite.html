    Hi, <p>
        This website is being developed inspired by a desire to do something, in addition to merely work on upgrading and staying current with skills relevant to my profession.
    <p>
        A humanitarian effort like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naam_Foundation" target="_blank">NAAM movement for Farmer Suicides in Maharashtra (India)</a> has different ways by which we can help.
        Sometimes organized accounting may take a backseat to the more urgent needs and emotions to resolve things, help etc. Thus enters an idea into my head to use a subject matter to apply whatever I am in the process of learning.
        <br />

        At this point, this is a simple accounting web site with the aim of tracking finances, how much the inflow is, what is the deficit, how the funds have  been used, etc.
    <p />
    While, as said, it was initiated with NAAM as an inspiration, it can be applied to any calamity or disaster situation, or any regular situation where a budget is used to maintain
    a list of items, say a transport service which maintains a bunch of trucks.<p />
    <a ng-click="scrollTo('Elements')"><li>Components</a></li>
    <a ng-click="scrollTo('status')"><li>Status   ({{todayShort}})</a></li>
    <a ng-click="scrollTo('pending')"><li> Pending ({{todayShort}})</a></li>
    <a ng-click="scrollTo('technical')"><li>Technical</a></li>

    I identified and am in the process of developing the following elements:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <a href="../budget/home.html#/budgetStatus">High Level Budget Status</a>.. Gives an overview of Available, Used and Deficit (required) quantities<br />
            Gives a listing of budget history, contributions, allocations. Also one can allocate the available funds.
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="../budget/home.html#/contributors">Contributions</a>.. <br />
            Gives a list of contributions - name, amount, currency, etc. Adding a contribution automatically updates budget status and history

        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="../budget/home.html#/entityFinanceSummaries">Entity Summaries</a>.. <br />
            A summary of entities involved within the framework of budget distribution. Summary of entities in status of allocated (budget was allocated),
            allocable (budget is available, but not yet allocable) and unallocated (budget not available)<br />
            List of entities with their budget specifics. Add entity. Drill down item wise expenses for an entity

        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="../budget/home.html#/settings">Settings</a>.. <br />
            Iteratively removing the hard coding, this page right now has the option of adding and editing currencies, flushing data and showing or hiding help texts on each page.
            <font color="blue">(WIP - working on loading and saving data from and to external comma separated files)</font>

    <a name="status"><h3>Status </h3></a>
    <li>What you are seeing here is a proof of concept user interface not connected to a database with or without sample data.
    <font color="blue">I am injecting the 'ngstorage'  module and '$localStorage' to persist data now. 
       </font> </li>
    <li>
        I have created the database for this site and the version of this website running on my local computer saves all data to a local database, so it can be read and updated later.(more in the 'Technical' section)
        I recently uploaded this to a public website. I am having some issues with connection strings.<br /><i> However, read on...</i>
    </li>
    <li>Even without the full blown (not connected to a regular data base) version, it is iteratively reaching full functionality completely client side 
    where <font color="blue"> 
    <br />a user can
    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* upload existing data files which they had saved prevously in the last session <i>(in place for contributors and currencies)</i>
    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* do their record updates and other work, and
    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* save their work overwriting the existing, or writing to a new, set of files(You can currently download the records you have saved on the Settings page)</font>
</li>
    <a name="pending"><h3>Pending  </h3></a>

    <li> Documentation on how to use this site. Planning to style in some sliding or pop up help windows soon</li>
    <li> Refining the look - styling. Validations</li>
    <li> This website is also not secure, but I'm thinking that this may be deployed on an internal computer, and it doesnt hold sensitive data  </li>
    <li> Reduce hard coding (e.g. Dates in the client-only version), need to make more stuff configurable. Adding lookups like drop downs, etc.<font color="blue">(Currencies are now configurable)</font>  </li>
    <li> Templatizing the names and other configurability, e.g. the terms 'contributor' and 'entity' will be made configurable and can be renamed 'Donor' and 'Village' or 'funding' and 'vehicle' </li>
    <li> Resolve issue of database connectivity on hosted deployment.  </li>
    <li> Code related and some specifics
        <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Data base / WCF flow to catch up with client functionality - entity summary and itens, currencies..
        <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Implement upload Entity Summary and Item data from files. (Re-think logic on how to save and upload Entity Summary and Item data to files)
        <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* One 'fileinput-upload button' functionality.
        <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Delete unwanted code 
        <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Add Inline documentation
        <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Merge Entity finance summary and entity item processing in the same set of files.
        <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Add 'append vs overwrite' choice for data when working completely client side.
        <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Headers for downloaded csv data files.
        <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Maybe create a separate mvc flow for bugs and requirements(?).

    <li>
        The Web application UI is written in AngularJS/HTML/CSS with gradual increasing infusion of bootstrap styling cues.<br />
        The fully vertical version consumes an asp.net 4.5/C# WCF web service which in turn talks to a Sql Server database through Entity Framework.
        (I introduced a global variable in the angular code to switch between using  in memory and dB data)
